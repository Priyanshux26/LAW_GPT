Headnotes Societies Registration Act, 1860 – Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950 – Whether the Working President could have convened the election meeting for 08.09.2002 as according to the Objectors, it was only the Secretary or in the alternative the President who could have convened the meeting under the bye laws: Held: The effective office bearers of the Society namely the President, Vice-President and the Secretary of the Society had expired – Prior to his death, the President due to his poor health, the Executive Body under his presidentship passed a resolution on 01.07.1997 empowering appellant no. 1 to be designated as the Working President – He was recognised was by almost all the members of the General Body – In the instant case, it was not only appropriate but also legal for the surviving members to request for convening a meeting – Further, as many as 16 members had requested in writing for convening the meeting – If the submission of the Objectors is to be accepted that the Working President could * Author [2024] 1 S.C.R. 1063 Adv Babasaheb Wasade & Ors. v. Manohar Gangadhar Muddeshwar & Ors. not convene the meeting, then no alternative has been suggested by the Objectors as to who could convene the meeting – Even the Vice-President and the Joint-Secretary had also passed away and they had also not been replaced by any fresh elections – The only person who could be said to be managing the affairs of the Society was the Working President and in particular, when all the 16 surviving and valid members had made a request for convening a meeting, no fault could be found with the decision of the Working President to convene the meeting – The other option could have been that all the 16 members could have themselves nominated any one of the members to chair the meeting of the Executive Body and thereafter they could have proceeded to take appropriate decisions – In such situation, the convening of the meeting for holding the elections on 08.09.2002 cannot be faulted with.
