As the court observed in Durga Shankar Mehta v. Thakur Raghuraj Singh [AIR 1954 SC 520 : [1955] 1 SCR 267, 272 : 9 ELR 494] Article 136 “vests in the Supreme Court a plenary jurisdiction in the matter of entertaining and hearing appeals by grant of special leave”. 22. Nonetheless, there is a limitation which, in our opinion, is of immediate relevance. It is a limitation in-built in to the jurisdiction of the court and flows from the nature and character of the case intended to be brought before the court. It is a limitation which requires compliance despite the apparent plenitude of power vested in the court. When a petition is presented to the [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1251 M/s Karnataka Emta Coal Mines Limited and Another v. Central Bureau of Investigation court under Article 136, the court will have due regard to the nature and character of the case sought to be brought before it when entertaining and disposing of the petition. [ emphasis added] 19.3 In Khoday Distilleries Limited and Others v. Mahadeshwara S.S.K. Limited,97 this Court observed that Article 136 commences with a non-obstante clause, the words are of overriding effect and clearly indicate the intention of the framers of the Constitution that it is a special jurisdiction and a repository of residuary powers unfettered by any Statute or any provisions of Chapter IV of Part V of the Constitution of India. It was also observed that the jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution cannot be barred by the Statute since it is an extraordinary power. 19.4 In State of Punjab and others v. Rafiq Masih (White Washer) others,98 in the same strain, this Court has held that Article 136 is a special jurisdiction and can be described as a ‘residuary power, extraordinary in its amplitude, its limits when it chases injustice, is the sky itself’. It is a corrective jurisdiction that vests a discretion in this Court to settle the law clearly and makes the law operational thereby making it a binding precedent for the future instead of keeping it vague. 19.5 In Mekala Sivaiah v. State of Andhra Pradesh,99 this Court commented on the circumstances in which the power under Article 136 is exercised and held thus: “14. Before adverting to the merits of the contention raised, it is important to reiterate that Article 136 of the Constitution of India is an extraordinary jurisdiction which this Court exercises when it entertains an appeal by special leave and this jurisdiction, by its very nature, is exercisable only when this Court is satisfied that it is necessary to interfere in to prevent grave or serious miscarriage of justice. 97 [2019] 3 SCR 411 : (2012) 12 SCC 291 98 [2014] 13 SCR 1343 : AIR (2015) 1267 99 [2022] 6 SCR 989 : (2022) 8 SCC 253 1252 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 15. It is well settled by judicial pronouncement that Article 136 is worded in wide terms and powers conferred under the said Article are not hedged by any technical hurdles.
