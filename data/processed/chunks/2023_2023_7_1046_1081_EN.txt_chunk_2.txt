The court held it to be unnecessary that “a specific or separate notification withdrawing or revoking the notification should be issued”. This conflict was referred to a larger bench of five judges, in Trimurti Fragrances (P) Ltd v. Govt of NCT of Delhi (a case, which is part of the present G batch). The holding, that there is no conflict between the Agra Belting Works line of cases, and the Kothari Products Ltd. line of cases, therefore, concludes the question urged with respect to efficacy or validity of notifications introducing as entries in a schedule(s) and subjecting them to tax, when those articles are H M/S TRIMURTHI FRAGRANCES (P) LTD.

Radheshyam Gudakhu Factory (2018) 11 SCC 505; Commissioner, Sales Tax, U.P. v. Agra Belting Works [1987] 3 SCR 93; Sale Tax Officer, Sector IX, Kanpur v. Dealing Dairy Products & Anr (1994) 2 Supp SCC 639; State of Bihar v. Krishna Kuthar Kabra (1997) 9 SCC 763 – referred to. C 2. Pan masala was expressly mentioned in Chapter 21 for the first time, in 1995 in the CET Act. Note 3 defined ‘PanMasala’ as “any preparation containing betel nuts and any one or more of thefollowing ingredients, namely lime, katha (catechu) and tobacco, whether or not containing any other ingredients”. However, at the D same time, Chapter 24 contained a specific entry “tobacco” which enumerated tobacco, manufactured tobacco, substitutes etc. The relevant sub-heading at that time was 2404.41 which enumerated chewing tobacco, including preparations commonly known as khara masala, kimam, dokta, zarda, sukha and surti. Thus, the E CET Act itself made a distinction between pan masala - whether it contained tobacco, or not, and all forms of tobacco. Right from 1995, the distinction in the CET Act between pan masala (Chapter 21) and tobacco (Chapter 24), had been made. The definition of pan masala also clarified that despite one of its ingredients being tobacco, it would nevertheless be a separate article. Throughout F (till 2001), “Pan masala” and chewing tobacco have received different treatment. They are not interchangeable or synonymous expressions. Entry 2404 refers to chewing tobacco “including preparations commonly known as “Khara Masala”, “Kimam”, “Dokta”, “Zarda”, “Sukha” and “Surti””. Gudaku and snuff are G dealt with under a separate heading. The effect of inclusion of pan masala with tobacco in Chapter 24 and simultaneously that product’s exclusion from Chapter 21, as well as imposition of ADE with effect from 2001, on ‘pan masala containing tobacco’ meant that the product (i.e. pan masala without tobacco) went out, for the first time, of the reach of state sales tax.
