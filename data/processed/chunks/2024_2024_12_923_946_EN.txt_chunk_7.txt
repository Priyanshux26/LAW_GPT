An heir apparent or presumptive has no such reversionary interest as would enable him to object to any sale or gift made by the owner in possession; See Abdul Wdhid, L.P. 12 I.A., 91, and 11 Cal 597 (1885) 12 1885 SCCOnLine PC 4 13 [1973] 2 SCR 300 : (1973) 1 SCC 1 934 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports which was followed in Hasan Ali, 11 All 456, (1889). The converse is also true: a renunciation by an exepectant heir in the lifetime of his ancestor is not valid, or enforceable against him after the vesting of the inheritance.”” (Emphasis supplied) It is also important to note that the doctrine of partial partition does not apply to Mohammedan Law as the heirs therein are tenants-in- common. Succession is to a definite fraction of the estate in question. A.N. Ray, J. as his Lordship then was wrote in Syed Shah Ghulam Ghouse Mohiuddin v. Syed Shah Ahmed Mohiuddin Kamisul Quadri,14 as follows: “20. … In Mohammedan law the doctrine of partial partition is not applicable because the heirs are tenants- in-common and the heirs of the deceased Muslim succeed to the definite fraction of every part of his estate. The shares of heirs under Mohammedan law are definite and known before actual partition. Therefore on partition of properties belonging to a deceased Muslim there is division by metes and bounds in accordance with the specific share of each heir being already determined by the law.” 18. It is acknowledged that Islamic Law has four sources— (i) Quran (ii) Hadith (iii) Ijma and (iv) Qiyas. It is commonly accepted that all Islamic personal law has to derive from these four sources. There is a generally acknowledged division among these four sources as well. The Quran is pre-eminent and deserving of all primacy followed by the other three in that very . The question involved in these appeals also, of inheritance and/or gift must be decided in reference thereto only. The topic of inheritance has been dealt with primarily under Chapter 4 of the Quran,15 Al-Nisa. The relevant verses are as under: “4:11 Allah commands you regarding your children: the share of the male will be twice that of the female.1 If you 14 [1971] 3 SCR 734 : (1971) 1 SCC 597 15 https://quran.com/4 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 935 Mansoor Saheb (Dead) & Ors. v. Salima (D) By Lrs. & Ors. leave only two ˹or more˺ females, their share is two-thirds of the estate. But if there is only one female, her share will be one-half. Each parent is entitled to one-sixth if you leave offspring.2 But if you are childless and your parents are the only heirs, then your mother will receive one-third.3 But if you leave siblings, then your mother will receive one- sixth4—after the fulfilment of bequests and debts.5 ˹Be fair to˺ your parents and children, as you do not ˹fully˺ know who is more beneficial to you.6 ˹This is˺ an obligation from Allah. Surely Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.
