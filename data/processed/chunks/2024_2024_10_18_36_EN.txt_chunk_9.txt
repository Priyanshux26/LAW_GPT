32728 of 2015, are the selected candidates and they have been serving as primary school teachers. It was also averred in the affidavit that the Government of Manipur is agreeable to accommodate the writ petitioners against the existing vacancies. The Supreme Court in the dated 16.03.2016 barred appointment of those who had chosen not to challenge the selection process for last about 5 years. Such impression in the Commissioner’s affidavit was not only incorrect factually but the same also gave an impression to this Court that no other petitions were pending in the Courts. Therefore, the right of those aspirants in the pending cases was overlooked and not addressed by this Court in its dated 16.03.2016. 16. As can be gathered from the dated 06.10.2015, the Manipur High Court set aside the recommendation for appointment to 242 posts carved out for the OBC category candidates. The said pronouncement was not disturbed by the Supreme Court. In fact this Court did not really adjudicate the merits of the challenge to the High Court’s or had occasion to address the appointment claims of those, whose names may appear in the revised select list, in terms of the High Court’s dated 06.10.2015. 17. We have considered the nature of the recruitment process challenged in this proceeding. The inevitable conclusion from the foregoing discussion is that the selection list should be redrawn, in terms of High court’s dated 06.10.2015. Let us now look at the three categories of candidates claiming selection in the redrawn final list. The first category would be those who have qualified the interview and are already included in the list filed before this Court, the second category would be those who have qualified the interview but are not included in said list and the third category would consist of candidates who have not qualified the interview as such but are admitted as OBC candidates. 18. The selection of the OBC category candidates was found to be unmerited by the High Court. As can be appreciated the notification dated 12.09.2006 for appointment of 1423 primary teachers notified the State’s reservation policy in the following manner- 32 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Primary Teacher Gen. Category 910 ST 442 SC 29 Phy. Handicapped 42 1423 However, the review DPC noted that by way of the subsequent notification (dated 27.12.2006), the benefit of reservation has been extended to OBC category in the State of Manipur, following the 200-point formula. 19. Some of the selectees (after the revised exercise) may already be serving amongst the OBC category candidates by virtue of their open category merit. They would naturally be accommodated accordingly as per the revised exercise. Some of the selectees (after the revised exercise), could be amongst the appellants/petitioners in these pending cases, who would also be entitled to benefit of selection. Since the appointment to the 242 posts in the OBC category was interfered by the High Court, those posts would now be available for making appointment after the select list is redrawn, in terms of the High Court’s dated 06.10.2015.
