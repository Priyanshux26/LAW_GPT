Case Arising From CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal Nos. 5062-5099 of 2024 From the and dated 29.06.2017 of the High Court of M.P. at Gwalior in WA Nos.42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6 and 100 of 2017 and 425 of 2016 Appearances for Parties Pratap Venugopal, Sr. Adv., Ms. Surekha Raman, Amarjit Singh Bedi, Abhishek Anand, Ms. Unnimaya S, Shreyash Kumar, Advs. for the Appellant. Saurabh Mishra, A.A.G., Sunny Choudhary, Ajay Singh, Advs. for the Respondents. / of the Supreme Court Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha, J. 1. Leave Granted. 2. The short question for our consideration is the applicability of the relevant rule for imposition of penalty; whether it is the rule that existed when the violation occurred during the license period of 2009- 10 or the rule that was substituted in 2011 when proceedings for 670 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports penalty were initiated. As the substituted rule reduced the quantum of penalty, the appellant insists on its application but the statutory authorities as well as the Division Bench of the High Court rejected his case and imposed higher penalty under the old rule. 2.1 For the reasons to follow, we have accepted the contention of the appellant and, in allowing the appeal, determined that the purpose of the amendment is to achieve a proper balance between crime and punishment or the offence and penalty. In light of this, and recognizing that classifying offenders into before or after the amendment for imposing higher and lower penalties does not serve any public interest, we have directed that the substituted Rule alone will apply to pending proceedings. 3. Facts:- The appellant is a sub-licensee under the M.P. Excise Act, 19151 for manufacture, import and sale of Foreign Liquor, regulated under the Madhya Pradesh Foreign Liquor Rules, 19962. 3.1 Sub-licensees importing Foreign Liquor are granted transit permits in which the origin, quality, quantity and point of delivery of the imported liquor are recorded. At the point of destination, the consignment is verified for quality and quantity, and a certificate under Rule 13 is granted. Rule 16 prescribes the permissible limits of loss of liquor in transit due to leakage, evaporation, wastage etc. The purpose and object of this Rule is to prevent illegal diversion of liquor for unlawful sale and also to prevent evasion of excise duty. Relevant portion of Rule 16 is as follows:- “Rule 16. Permissible limits of losses.- (1) An allowance shall be made for the actual loss of spirit by leakage, evaporation etc., and of bottled foreign liquor by breakage caused by loading, unloading, handling etc.
