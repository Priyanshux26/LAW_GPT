The Police, upon investigation, filed a chargesheet bearing no.129/2020 before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Motihari (East Champaran) on 08th August 2020 under Sections 341, 329 and 504 IPC, against only one person, namely, Lakhpati Devi and observed that none of the others were to be sent up for trial. 6. The record reveals that Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate6- First, Motihari, took cognizance of the aforesaid incident. The said dated 21st February 2021, is not on record. Such taking of cognizance was challenged before the Sessions Judge, East Champaran, Motihari. The dated 16th July 2022 reveals that the learned ACJM, upon perusal of the case records, took cognizance against not only Lakhpati Devi but also all other persons named in the FIR. The Sessions Judge declined to interfere with the of cognizance. 7. It is in the aforesaid backdrop that the accused persons preferred Criminal Miscellaneous No.30562 of 2023 before the High Court of Judicature at Patna under Section 482, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973,7 seeking quashing thereof. The of the High Court dated 04th July 2024 is reproduced as under: “Heard learned counsel for the petitioners; learned APP for the State and learned counsel for the informant. 2. Heard. 3. Admit. 4. During pendency of this application, the operation of the dated 16.07.2022 passed by the learned Sessions Judge, East Champaran at Motihar in Criminal Revision No. 94 of 2022, shall remain stayed with respect to the petitioners only. ” 8. The complainant, aggrieved by the stay granted by the High Court, has approached this Court. During the hearing on 26th November 2024, learned counsel informed us that the petition seeking quashing of the cognizance stood withdrawn as on 22nd November 2024. 5 [2018] 14 SCR 755 : (2019) 2 SCC 703 6 Hereafter ‘ACJM’ 7 Hereafter ‘CrPC’ 1130 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 9. In ordinary circumstances, the petition could have been disposed of by requesting the Trial Court to proceed expeditiously with the trial of the accused persons, keeping in view that the offence was committed in the early part of 2020, and now we stand right at the door of 2025 however this case does not fall under ‘ordinary circumstances’. The FIR, as extracted above, shows that the victim, whose name is redacted for the purposes of maintaining the privacy of the said individual, was subjected to grave accusations and also disrobed and assaulted in public, which undoubtedly is an affront to her dignity. Certain other acts were also committed against her, which we refrain from mentioning again, for the full extent of which already stands extracted supra and because the reality that such acts are still a part of 21st century life is a fact that has shaken the conscience of this Court. Not only was the victim accused of witchcraft, but she was abused physically and verbally as well. Another person who was present amidst all this disturbance was also disrobed, and her jewellery was snatched.
