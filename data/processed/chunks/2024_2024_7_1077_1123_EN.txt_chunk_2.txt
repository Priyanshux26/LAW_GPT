[Para 56] 1080 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Single & Continuing cause of action – Difference explained: Held: When an act is final and complete and becomes a cause of action for injury to the plaintiff, it is single, and the plaintiff is entitled to sue, for the wrongful act – But if there is repetition of a wrongful act or omission, it will comprise a continuing cause of action – Neither do repeated breaches of continuing obligations constitute a continuing wrong nor intermittent breaches of a continuing obligation; rather there has to be present an element of continuance in both, the breach and the obligation. [Paras 74,75] Legal Maxim – Secundum allegata et probate – Court can arrive at its decision only on the basis of the claims and proof led by the parties – Even if a point of “continuing wrong/breach/ offence” is traceable in the pleadings, the court ought not to accept it mechanically: Held: The court cannot traverse beyond the pleadings and make out a case which was never pleaded, such principle having originated from the fundamental legal maxim secundum allegata et probate, i.e., the court will arrive at its decision on the basis of the claims and proof led by the parties – The assertion of the contumacious conduct being in the nature of a “continuing wrong/breach/offence” is factual and has to be borne from the pleadings on record – Law is well-settled that when a point is not traceable in the pleas set out either in a plaint or a written statement, findings rendered on such point by the court would be unsustainable as that would amount to an altogether new case being made out for the party – Even if a point of “continuing wrong/breach/offence” is traceable in the pleadings, the court ought not to accept it mechanically; particularly, in entertaining an action for contempt, which is quasi-criminal in nature, the court should be slow and circumspect and be fully satisfied that there has indeed been a “continuing wrong/breach/ offence”.
