It was submitted that Section 3 of the Tamil Nadu Cultivating Tenants Protection Act, 1955 (hereinafter referred to as the “Act”) does not provide for eviction after the deposit of the due amount(s) and in the present case, the delay, not being inordinate, such (s) ought not to have been passed. It was the G further contention of the learned counsel that Section 3 of the Act also does not specify delay in deposit of rent as a ground for eviction. 14.

No. 5 of 2022 for police protection and delivery, which was finally effected on 13.10.2022. ANALYSIS, REASONING AND CONCLUSION: F 18. Though this Court had verbally permitted filing written submissions, however, the appellants filed written submissions totalling 16-pages (including extracts from the Act), that too without forwarding a copy thereof to the respondents. Further, belatedly, the appellants also filed a list of s, again without serving the other side. G 19. Thus, this Court, ordinarily, would have rejected even considering the same, but nonetheless, in the interest of justice, has surveyed both the written submissions and the s submitted, more so for the reason that in view of the eventually being passed by us, no prejudice H 838 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A is going to be caused to the other side due to such non-supply. We shall refer to the s relied on by the appellants at the appropriate place infra.
