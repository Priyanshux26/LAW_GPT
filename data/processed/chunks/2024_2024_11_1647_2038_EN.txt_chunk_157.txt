Relevance of Islamic Academy of Education (supra) and P.A. Inamdar (supra) lies in the fact that these decisions 27 (2002) 8 SCC 713 28 (2002) 8 SCC 712 29 Writ Petition (C) No.331 of 2005 30 (2003) 6 SCC 697 31 (2005) 6 SCC 537 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1873 Aligarh Muslim University v. Naresh Agarwal & Ors. attempted to iron out creases arising from the decision in T.M.A. Pai Foundation (supra). If indeed question 3(a) required an answer, I would be persuaded to think that either Islamic Academy of Education (supra) or P.A. Inamdar (supra) would have answered it. That the Constitution Benches did not attempt to answer question 3(a) should leave none in doubt that the said question did not merit an answer. 32. After the dated 11th March 2003 of disposal in Shahal H. Musaliar (supra),the matter lay dormant for a period of time; it was resuscitated when AMU, through its Executive Council, passed a resolution dated 19th May 2005, reserving 50% seats in postgraduate programmes for Indian Muslims. This resolution was challenged before the High Court invoking its writ jurisdiction. Both the Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court held that the reservation, sought to be made, could not be enforced. The Division Bench, relying on Azeez Basha (supra), went even further than the Single Judge and set aside the 1981 amendment to the AMU Act. The Division Bench observed that the 1981 amendment sought to side step Azeez Basha (supra) without removing the basis on which Azeez Basha (supra) was rendered. The of the Division Bench was carried in appeal before this Court by AMU and it is on such appeal that the re-referral was passed by the bench of 3 (three) Judges, which I propose to note now. 33. On 12th February, 2019, the bench of 3 (three)Judges in Aligarh Muslim University (supra),after noticing the aforesaid developments, proceeded to hold that “the correctness of the question arising from the decision of this Court in S. Azeez Basha (supra) has remained undetermined”. The that followed such observation reads as under: “9. That apart, the decision of this Court in Prof. Yashpal and another vs. State of Chhattisgarh and others and the amendment of the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions Act, 2004 made in the year 2010 would also require an authoritative pronouncement on the aforesaid question formulated, as set out above, besides the correctness of the view expressed in the of this Court in S. Azeez Basha (supra) which has been extracted above. 1874 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 10. Ordinarily and in the normal course the judicial discipline would require the Bench to seek a reference of this matter by a Five Judges Bench. However, having regard to the background, as stated above, when the precise question was already referred to a Seven Judges Bench and was, however, not answered, we are of the view that the present question, set out above, should be referred to a Bench of Hon’ble Seven Judges.
