14. In so far assessment year 1992-1993 is concerned, the assessing officer passed the reassessment also on 21.03.2002 under Section 144/147 of the Act determining the total income of the assessee at Rs.25,06,660.00. Thereafter allocation of income was made amongst the partners in the manner indicated in the of reassessment. 15. At this stage, we may mention that the assessing officer had worked out the escaped income for the three assessment years of 1990-91, 1991-92 and 1992-93 at Rs.50,96,041.00. This amount was further apportioned between the three assessment years in proportion to the sales declared by the assessee in the aforesaid assessment years as under: Sr. No. Assessment year Amount 1. 1990-91 Rs.19,05,476.00 2. 1991-92 Rs.16,83,910.00 3. 1992-93 Rs.15,06,655.00 Total Rs.50,96,041.00 rounded off to Rs.50,96,040.00 16. Against the aforesaid three reassessment s for the assessment years 1990-91, 1991-92 and 1992-93, assessee preferred three 650 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports appeals before the first appellate authority i.e. Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), IV Cochin (briefly “the CIT(A)” hereinafter). Assessee raised the ground that it had disclosed all material facts necessary for completing the assessments. The assessments having been completed under Section 143(3) of the Act, the assessments could not have been reopened after expiry of four years from the end of the relevant assessment year as per the proviso to Section 147 of the Act. It was pointed out that the limitation period for the last of the three assessment years i.e. 1992-93, had expired on 31.03.1997 whereas the notices under Section 148 of the Act were issued and served on the assessee only on 29.03.2000. Therefore, all the three reassessment proceedings were barred by limitation. The assessee also argued that the alleged income escaping assessment could not be computed on an estimate basis. In the present case, the assessing officer had allocated the alleged escaped income for the three assessment years in proportion to the corresponding sales turnover. It was further argued that as per Section 282(2), notice under Section 148 of the Act in the case of a partnership firm was required to be made to a member of the firm. In the present case, the notices were issued to the partnership firm. Therefore, such notices could not be treated as valid. 16.1. CIT(A) rejected all the above contentions urged by the assessee. CIT(A) relied on Section 139(9)(f) of the Act and thereafter held that the assessee had not furnished the details as per the aforesaid provisions and therefore fell short of the requirements specified therein. Vide the common appellate dated 26.02.2004, CIT(A) held that, as the assessee had failed to disclose all material facts necessary to make assessments, therefore it could not be said that the reassessment proceedings were barred by limitation in terms of the proviso to Section 147. The other two grounds raised by the assessee were also repelled by the first appellate authority. Thereafter, CIT(A) made a detailed examination of the factual aspect whereafter it proposed enhancement of the quantum of escaped income.
