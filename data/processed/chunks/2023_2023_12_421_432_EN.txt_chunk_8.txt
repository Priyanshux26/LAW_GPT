9. In Tiwari Kanhaiyalal v. CIT [(1975) 4 SCC 101 : 1975 SCC (Tax) 214:1975 SCC (Cri) 312] where prosecution was laid after the repeal of the Income Tax Act, 1922, the contention raised was that saving clauses in Section 297 of 1961 Income Tax Act did not save the punishment incurred under the Repealed Act, therefore, recourse to Section 6 of General Clauses Act cannot be had, was negatived by this Court and it held that the repeal had not aff ected the liability incurred under Section 52 of the Income Tax Act, 1922 and it continued even after its repeal. The same view was reiterated in CIT v. M/s Shah Sadiq & Sons [(1987) 3 SCC 516, 524:1987 SCC (Tax) 270]. Accordingly, we hold that despite repeal of Act 7 of 1947 by operation of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act read with Section 81(2), the penalty incurred by the appellant continued to subsist and the respondents are entitled to institute the proceedings, conduct investigation or enquiry and impose such penalty.” (emphasis added) 14. Hence, the view taken by us in earlier paragraphs is fortifi ed by the above decision. 15. The appeal fails, and the same is, accordingly, dismissed. As the complaint remained stayed from 7th January 2011, we direct the Trial Court to give necessary out-of-turn priority to the disposal of the complaint bearing CC.No.14/CW/2002, which is the subject matter of this appeal.
