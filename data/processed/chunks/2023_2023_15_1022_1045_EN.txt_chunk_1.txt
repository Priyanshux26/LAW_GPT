Rather than replicate the background, we set it out below : “1 The National Company Law Tribunal1 dismissed the application fi led by the fi rst respondent for the grant of interim relief by an dated 31 December 2019. The fi rst respondent is in appeal before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal2. Admittedly, no interim relief operated in favour of the fi rst respondent during the pendency of the appeal. 2 The appeal has been heard and s were reserved by the NCLAT on 21 September 2023. However, while reserving s, the NCLAT has directed the parties “to maintain status quo as was available prior to EOGM dated 03.05.2019” till the judgement is delivered. No reasons have been indicated by the NCLAT even prima facie for issuing the interim , particularly in the context of the fact that there was no interim relief operating since the dismissal of the application for interim relief on 31 December 2019. It is admitted that no relief was obtained by the fi rst respondent in the proceedings before the Bombay High Court, as well. 1 “NCLT” 2 “NCLAT” ORBIT ELECTRICALS PRIVATE LIMITED v. 1025 DEEPAK KISHAN CHHABRIA & ORS. 3 In the circumstances, we vacate the interim direction as noted above. The Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the company, Finolex Cables Limited is to take place on 29 September 2023. Any action which is taken on proposed resolution No 4 pertaining to the appointment of the Executive Chairperson shall be subject to the outcome of the appeal which is pending before the NCLAT. 4 Subject to the aforesaid modifi cations, the appeals are allowed and the impugned is set aside to the aforesaid extent. 5 Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.” 2 By the above of this Court, the interim direction which was passed by the NCLAT on 21 September 2023 at the stage of reserving s, restoring the status quo ante “as was available prior to EOGM dated 3 May 2019” was vacated bearing in mind that : (i) No reasons at all were indicated; (ii) No interim relief had operated since the dismissal of the application for interim relief on 31 December 2019; and (iii) No relief was obtained by the fi rst respondent in proceedings before the Bombay High Court.
