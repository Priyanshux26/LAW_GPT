Fourth, that the commercial wisdom of CoC was not justiciable and once the CoC had approved the resolution plan by the requisite majority, there was very limited scope of interference by the Courts. Fifth, that the Appellate Tribunal has overstepped its jurisdiction by D declaring the resolution applicant ineligible under Section 88 of the Trusts Act and disqualified under Section 164(2)(b) of the Companies Act. Sixth, that the claims of related party creditors cannot be treated at par with the unrelated creditors. And seventh, that Section 12-A IBC application of the promoter was merely a dilatory tactic and that he was E not entitled to file any such application. These and other grounds raised in these appeals have been duly contested by the respondents with their respective stands and positions in these cases. This apart, some of the financial creditors have also moved the applications for impleadment and have placed their respective viewpoints for consideration. F 4. During the pendency of these appeals, this Court did not stay the operation of impugned dated 17.02.2022; and during the course of hearing of these appeals, on 07.03.2022, it was informed by RP that pursuant to the impugned, another meeting of CoC had been conducted on 03.03.2022. It is noticed that in the said CoC meeting held on 03.03.2022, the settlement proposal of the promoter was voted against G by 51.81% of the voting share. After conclusion of initial hearing, while reserving , this Court also took note of the fact that further meeting of CoC was slated for 21.03.2022; and it was provided that the meetings/proceedings of the CoC could go on but the entire process shall remain subject to the final s to be passed in these appeals. H 790 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 9 S.C.R. A 4.1. These matters were again taken on board on 20.05.2022 when this Court took note of the submissions made in another application moved by the resolution applicant for directions while pointing out that the fresh process had been initiated by the RP by publication of Form G on 26.04.2022, inviting fresh EOIs. Therein, the resolution applicant sought interim stay over the fresh process initiated by RP or in the alternative, B to stay the operation of the impugned as regards declaration of his disqualification, and to direct the RP to consider his EOI in the fresh process so initiated. This Court, however, declined to pass any other with reference to the fact that all the proceedings remain subject to the final s in these appeals. C 4.2. Yet again, Civil Appeal No. 1682-1683 of 2022 was taken on the board on 17.11.2022 and learned counsel for the parties were heard further, in view of an application moved on behalf of the promoter and erstwhile director of the corporate debtor (IA No. 168602 of 2022), seeking permission to bring on record subsequent events that his proposal D of settlement under Section 12-A of the Code was accepted by CoC on 12.10.2022 by 100% of the voting share, i.e., unanimously; and the same had been placed before the Adjudicating Authority for approval.
