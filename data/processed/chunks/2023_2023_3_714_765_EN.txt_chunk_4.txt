But if it was not possible to C accommodate the writ petitioners, owing to non-availability of posts, then the entire selection was quashed and set aside and a fresh Selection Committee was to be constituted to conduct fresh interviews of all the candidates who had earlier appeared before it and a fresh Select List was to be prepared. Further, till the said exercise was to be carried out, the selected candidates were to D be continued. The Division Bench, however, quashed the Selection List in its entirety and directed and observed that no further appointments could be made against the vacancies that may have occurred subsequent to the appointments already made and that a fresh selection was to be made by re-advertising the E posts. Consequently, the selection of drug inspectors was quashed in toto and a direction was issued to complete the exercise afresh within six months and till then, the appointed candidates as drug inspectors were to be continued. The directions issued by both the Single Judge as well as by the Division Bench were not in accordance with law and hence, the F said directions have to be quashed. [Para 17][764-D-F] 1.10.
