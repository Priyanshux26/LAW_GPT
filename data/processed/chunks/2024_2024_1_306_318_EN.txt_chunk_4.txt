He stated that Sumit Gupta (A-2) disclosed to him that he borrowed money from the deceased and as such there was pressure on him to return the money. When the deceased demanded the money on 10.04.2004, he was apprehensive of being insulted and therefore planned to kill the deceased with the help of other accused. For this purpose, he called the deceased to the T-Point at Kaithal, Dhand Road at 9.30 PM saying that he has arranged the repayment. By the time the deceased came there, other accused were already present at the spot, they all assaulted 312 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the deceased with dandas, killed him and threw the dead body in the field near Shergha Road. This witness also stated that all other accused disclosed similar version. Himself being an Ex. Sarpanch, he has thereafter produced the accused before the SHO Police Station Kaithal. 15. Having considered the submissions of the appellant about contradictions in the statement of this witness (PW-10), the High Court concluded, “even if we ignored the evidence of PW-10 before whom the appellants have made an extra judicial confession having committed the crime, there is more emphatic evidence led by the prosecution compelling this Court to believe that the appellants had committed the crime of murdering Shamsher Singh.” In other words, the High Court has not relied on the evidence of PW-10 as it found other sufficient evidence. 16. We have however independently examined the evidence of PW-10 and come to the conclusion that this witness is not trustworthy and this is evident from the following: a. This witness denied having met the deceased earlier “I have never met Shamsher Singh earlier”. However, the complainant (PW-20) in his statement on 11.04.2004 says “today we came to know that Malkhan, Prem Singh, Balbir Sarpanch met Shamsher on Dhand Road, Kaithal at about 10 PM.” The said statement is also recorded in the FIR and charge sheet, though he leaves doubt about this version in his deposition. b. Similarly, Balwant Singh (PW-18) in his deposition on 08.12.2006 states that, “since Shamsher Singh did not reach back to home and hence his family members started searching for him. Malkhan, Prem Singh and Balbir Singh r/o Geong informed that Shamsher Singh was seen at Dhand Road, Kaithal”. c. Further, Balbir Singh, ASI (PW-21) also deposed about the deceased having met the Sarpanch. He says “it is correct to state that Balbir Sarpanch, Malkhan and Prem Singh residents of Geong had met Shamsher Singh deceased on 10.04.2004 at 10 PM at Dhand Road, Kaithal, according to statements of PWs gathered at the spot that is Sunil and Balwant PWs.” 17. Apart from the above referred contradiction, yet another fact about the extra-judicial confession on 17.04.2004 is noteworthy. The statement of [2024] 1 S.C.R. 313 Pradeep Kumar v. State of Haryana the accused Sumit Gupta (A-2) in his Section 313 CrPC statement is that they were arrested on 11.04.2004 itself and not 17.04.2004. This statement gets corroborated by the deposition of Rajesh (PW-11), who stated that; “Thereafter I read news in newspaper regarding murder on 12.04.2004.
