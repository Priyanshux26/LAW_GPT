The State specifically 1316 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports sought for modification of the dated 21.11.2014 whereunder it was required to issue TDR as per TDR rules and wanted to pay compensation as per the calculation in the original award of 1996 in similar terms of the dated 15.02.1999 passed on IA No.2 and this has been categorically turned down or rejected by this Court by dated 17.05.2022. For these myriad reasons Government dated 24.05.2024 cannot be accepted as substantial compliance of the s dated 21.11.2014, 17.05.2022 and 19.03.2024 and it stands rejected. 22. In fact, the State itself has categorically admitted in its Government dated 23.02.2021 the value of the TDR to be issued in favour of the claimants would be as under: Total area 15 Acres 36 Guntas, Total 639 Guntas 639 x 1089 = 695871 sq. ft. x 2 = 1391742 sq. feet. It is also admitted that the gross value is Rs.2,70,000 per Sq. Meter. However, it has determined the value as 0.4 times of the land value that is 1,08,000 per Sq. Meter on the premise that it is to be construed as an agricultural land. This very plea came to be raised for the modification of the dated 21.11.2014 and it was turned down by this Court by dated 17.05.2022 and it was reiterated that the TDR is required to be issued as per TDR Rules namely by adopting market value of the land. The value of the land cannot be anything less than market value as already determined under Section 45B of the Karnataka Stamp Act 1957. At the cost of repetition it requires to be noticed that the State Government itself has considered the market value as per guidance value at Rs. 2,70,000 per sq. meter fixed under Karnataka Stamp Act, 1957 and has adopted 0.4 times of the said value to calculate the TDR for the reason that the Bangalore Palace falls within agricultural zone which cannot be market value under TDR Rules. No material whatsoever has been placed by the State to depict that the subject land is to be construed as falling within agricultural zone. In fact, the subject property was utilized as a private residence of the then Maharaja of Mysore since long number of years and it is situated in the heart of city of Bangalore. There cannot be any cavial to the fact that TDR is required to be issued as per TDR Rules. In fact, not dwelling upon further on this aspect, it can be safely concluded that valuation of the subject land even according to the State was [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1317 Chaduranga Kanthraj Urs and Anr. v. P. Ravi Kumar and Ors. determined as per the guidance value then prevailing but restricted it to 40% of the guidance value by treating it as agriculture land without any basis whatsoever. The notifications issued under Section 45B of the Karnataka Stamp Act prescribes the guidance value and this value alone ought to have been adopted and there cannot be any reduction or subtraction in that regard.
