The Supreme Court in its dated 16th November, 1992 in the case of Indra Sawhney v. Union of India, B however, observed that reservation of appointments or posts under Article 16(4) is confined to initial appointment and cannot extend to reservation in the matter of promotion. This ruling of the Supreme Court will adversely affect the interests of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. Since their C representation in services in the States have not reached the required level, it is necessary to continue the existing dispensation of providing reservation in promotion in the case of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. In view of the commitment of the Government to protect the interests of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, D the government has decided to continue the existing policy of reservation in promotion for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. To carry out this it is necessary to amend Article 16 of the Constitution by inserting a new clause (4-A) in the said article to provide for reservation in promotion for E the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.” Thus, reservations in promotions were extended to members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes alone. II. HISTORY OF RESERVATIONS FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES F 6. In Union of India v. National Federation of the Blind7, this court had reiterated the distinction between ‘vertical’ reservations for backward classes of citizens as delineated in Indra Sawhney (supra) and ‘horizontal’ reservations for persons with disabilities under Section 338 of the erstwhile Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, G 7Union of India v.

A Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 (“1995 Act”), as follows: “42. A perusal of Indra Sawhney [1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC 385 : AIR 1993 SC 477] would reveal that the ceiling of 50% reservation applies B only to reservation in favour of Other Backward Classes under Article 16(4) of the Constitution of India whereas the reservation in favour of persons with disabilities is horizontal, which is under Article 16(1) of the Constitution. In fact, this Court in the said pronouncement has used the example of 3% reservation in favour of persons with disabilities while dealing C with the rule of 50% ceiling. Para 812 of the clearly brings out that after selection and appointment of candidates under reservation for persons with disabilities they will be placed in the respective rosters of reserved category or open category respectively on the basis of the category to which D they belong and, thus, the reservation for persons with disabilities per se has nothing to do with the ceiling of 50%.
