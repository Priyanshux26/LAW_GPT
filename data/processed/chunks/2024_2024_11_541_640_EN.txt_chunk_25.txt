Rule 2 of the MV Rules provides certain additional definitions. For instance, Rule 2(c) defines an ‘agricultural tractor’ as under: “agricultural tractor” means any mechanically propelled 4-wheel vehicle designed to work with suitable implements for various field operations and/or trailers to transport agricultural materials. Agricultural tractor is a non-transport vehicle’ [emphasis supplied] 27. Significantly, a non-transport vehicle is defined in Rule 2(h): ““non-transport vehicle” means a motor vehicle which is not a transport vehicle” 578 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 28. The definition of ‘e-cart’,17 ‘e-rickshaw’,18 ‘Battery operated vehicle’,19 ‘road ambulance’,20 ‘school bus’,21 ‘special purpose vehicle’,22 ‘motor caravan’,23 ‘puller tractor’24 and different categories of vehicles such as ‘Category L’25 and ‘Category M’26 are also provided in the MV Rules. 29. The above definition(s) in the MV Act and MV Rules would indicate that they focus on various aspects including reference by (i) weight such as light motor vehicle and heavy goods vehicle; (ii) the intended use such as educational institution bus, public service or private service and also (iii) the vehicle types such as omnibuses and motor cars. Therefore, the scheme of the Act is not exactly either user-based or weight-based but is a combination of both. It also takes into account the evolving transportation sector which is reflected in the introduction of new categories of vehicles through various amendments such as adapted vehicles, e-carts, and e-rickshaws. Notably, the Supreme Court has also recognized27 that hybrid rickshaws, commonly referred to as ‘jugaad’ in India, fall under the definition of Motor Vehicle u/s 2(28) of the MV Act. 30. For our discussion, much turns on the definition of LMV contained in Section 2(21) of the MV Act: “light motor vehicle” means a transport vehicle or omnibus the gross vehicle weight of either of which or a motorcar or tractor or road-roller the unladen weight of any of which, does not exceed 7,500 kilograms.” [emphasis supplied] 31. The term ‘transport vehicle’, ‘gross vehicle weight’, ‘motor car’, ‘tractor’, ‘road roller’, ‘unladen weight’ and ‘gross vehicle weight’ are also separately defined in the MV Act as noted earlier. In the 17 Rule 2(cc) 18 Rule 2(cb) 19 Rule 2(u) 20 Rule 2(zb) 21 Rule 2(zc) 22 Rule 2(zd) 23 Rule 2(za) 24 Rule 2(y) 25 Rule 2(i) 26 Rule 2(k) 27 Rajasthan SRTC v. Santosh (2013) 7 SCC 107 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 579 M/s Bajaj Alliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Rambha Devi & Ors. context, Mr. Dave, Learned Senior Counsel appearing for one of the insurance companies presented to us a visual 1 page representation of the definition of LMV which being useful, is reproduced below: 580 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 32. A plain reading of the definition clause of LMV as is also clear from the diagram above shows that LMV, inter-alia, ‘means’ a ‘Transport Vehicle’. The use of the word ‘means’ is crucial here which suggests specifics. When the statute says that a word or a phrase shall “mean” (instead of say “include”), it is quite certainly a ‘hard and fast’, strict and exhaustive definition.
