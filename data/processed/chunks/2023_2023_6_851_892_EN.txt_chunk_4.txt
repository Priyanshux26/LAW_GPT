[Paras 46, 47, 49 and 50][876-E-G; 877-A; 878-D-F] 1.11 There is no dispute that the death of the deceased D occurred due to culpable homicide and not due to accident or suicide. The sine qua non for the application of an Exception to Section 300 always is that it is a case of murder but the accused claims the benefit of the Exception to bring it out of that Section and to make it a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Therefore, it is assumed that this would be a case of E murder and it is for the accused to show the applicability of the Exception. [Para 57][890-E] 1.12 The extent of injuries suffered by the deceased is noticed, as it appears from the deposition of the PW 7 who carried out the post mortem. Having regard to the nature of the injuries F caused by dangerous weapons like sickle and sword which, were applied on the vital part of the body, there is no escape from the conclusion that it is a case of Section 302 IPC. [Para 60][891-B- C] 1.13 The submission that the case would fall within the G Exception 4 to Section 300 IPC and such benefit be extended to the accused cannot be accepted. Assuming for the moment that the incident had occurred in the heat of the moment and fight was also sudden, the fact that the appellants inflicted as many as nine blows with a dangerous weapon on the deceased who was H BALU SUDAM KHALDE & ANR. v. THE STATE OF 857 MAHARASHTRA unarmed and was helpless should not be overlooked. For cases A to fall within clause (3) of Section 300 IPC, it is not necessary that the offender intended to cause death, so long as the death ensues from the intentional bodily injury or injuries sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. Thus, no case is made out by the appellants to interfere with the impugned B and of the High Court. [Para 61, 62][891-C-F] Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v.
