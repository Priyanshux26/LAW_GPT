12 (2000) 6 SCC 359 13 (2019) 4 SCC 376 2300 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports (ii) Dismissal of the special leave petition by speaking or reasoned —no merger, but rule of discipline and Article 141 attracted. (iii) Leave granted—dismissal without reasons— merger results.” [Emphasis supplied] 50. In the instant case, leave to appeal was granted vide the dated 27.08.2010, and the Civil Appeals preferred by the State of Haryana were then dismissed on 16.11.2016. Therefore, since the previous SLPs arising out of the same impugned judgement were dismissed after granting leave, arguably, the doctrine of merger would be attracted. 51. However, we may hasten to add that in Kunhayammed (supra), this Court held that the doctrine of merger is neither a doctrine of constitutional law nor of statutory recognition. Since it is a common law principle directed towards judicial propriety, the same should not be applied in a straitjacket manner, and the nature of facts and circumstances of that particular case should be considered. 52. Still further, a three-judge bench of this Court—to which one of us (Surya Kant, J.) was a member—in GNCTD v. BSK Realtors,14 analyzed the aforementioned exception to the doctrine of merger and held that the exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution, which enables the Court to do complete justice, would fall under the four corners of such exception. 53. Applying the afore-cited principle to the facts and circumstances of the instant case, we have found that the impugned judgement of the High Court is patently unjust and could adversely affect the subject acquisition, leading to significant harm to the public at large. In light of this, we find it a fit case to invoke our powers under Article 142 of the Constitution and carve out an exception to the doctrine of merger so as to do complete justice to the parties. 14 GNCTD v. BSK Realtors, 2024 INSC 455. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 2301 Haryana Urban Development Authority v. Abhishek Gupta etc. E. CONCLUSION AND DIRECTIONS 54. We, thus, deem it appropriate to allow these appeals and dispose of the matter in the following terms and directions: i. The Appeals are allowed; the impugned dated 15.07.2008 of the High Court, which is under challenge in this batch of appeals, is hereby set aside; ii. If there is any other judgement or of the High Court which is passed following the main judgement dated 15.07.2008, thereby quashing or adversely impacting the subject acquisition, such judgements or s are also deemed to be set aside; iii. In case no ‘award’ for the land owned by the Respondents was passed earlier, the same shall be passed expeditiously, and in any case within a period of 3 (three) months in accordance with the provisions of the 1894 Act; iv. If an award in respect of the Respondent’s land has already been passed under the 1894 Act, in that event, there will be no necessity to pass a fresh award. However, liberty is granted to the Respondents to avail their remedy under Section 18 of the 1894 Act, if so advised.
