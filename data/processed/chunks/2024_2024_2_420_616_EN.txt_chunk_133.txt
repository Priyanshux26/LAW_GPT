It is clear from the available data that majority of contribution through Bonds has gone to political parties which are ruling parties in the Centre and the States. There has also been a substantial increase in contribution/donation through Bonds. [2024] 2 S.C.R. 603 Association for Democratic Reforms & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. 70. Petitioner no. 1 —Association for Democratic Reforms has submitted the following table which showcases party-wise donation by corporate houses to national parties: PARTY-WISE CORPORATE DONATION (NATIONAL PARTIES) (IN RS.

We do not have the comments or official details in this regard from the Union of India or the ECI. The figures support our conclusion, but | would not, without certainty, base my analysis on these figures. However, we do have data of denomination/ sale of Bonds, as submitted by the petitioners, during the 27 phases from March 2018 to July 2023, which is as under: DENOMINATION WISE SALE OF EB DURING 27 PHASES (MARCH, 2018-JULY, 2023) No. of Electoral Amount Denomination Bonds Sold (In Rupees) 1 Crore 12,999 12,999 Crore (54.13%) (94.25%) 7,618 761.80 Crore 10 Lakhs (31.72%) (5.52%) 3,088 30.88 Crore 1 Lakh (12.86%) (0.22%) 208 20.80 Lakh 10 Thousand (0.86%) (0.001%) 1 Thousand 99 99,000 (0.41%) , Total | 24012 13791.8979 Cr. 604 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Analysis of this data shows that more than 50% of the Bonds in number, and 94% of the Bonds in value terms were for Rs.1 crore. This supports our reasoning and conclusion on the application of the doctrine of proportionality. This is indicative of the quantum of corporate funding through the anonymous Bonds. 71. The share of income from unknown sources for national parties rose from 66% during the years 2014-15 to 2016-17 to 72% during the years 2018-19 to 2021-22.
