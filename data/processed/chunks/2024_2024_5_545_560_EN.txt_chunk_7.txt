v. The State of Tamil Nadu and Others Etc. are not part of feeder category from which recruitment by transfer can be made for the post of Assistant Engineers. The of the learned Tribunal was challenged by the appellants herein by filing a writ petition being Writ Petition No. 7523 of 1997 titled Association of Engineers’ v. The Tamil Nadu Administrative Tribunal and Others (supra) before the Madras High Court. The Division Bench of the said High Court rejected the claim of the appellants herein and upheld the of the Tribunal. It will be relevant to refer to para (13) of the said , which reads thus: “13. It is also brought to our notice that the Special Rules were amended by G.O.Ms.No.1745 dated 10.10.1972, which were subsequently modified by G.O.Ms.No.1356 dated 02.08.1980 and on the basis of representation, the Government reconsidered those executive s and issued G.O.Ms.No.1 PWD dated 02.01.1990, stating that with effect from the date of the said , Junior Drafting Officer, Drafting Officer, Overseers and Technical Assistants, who have put in five years of service will be eligible to be appointed as Assistant Engineers by transfer of service on acquiring B.E./ A.M.E.E. degree qualification. We are satisfied that Rule 5 of the Special Rules in no way affects the implementation of the decision of the Tribunal in view of Rule 2(a)(5) of the Special Rules. As observed earlier, it is our duty to mention that in to implement the s passed in G.O.Ms.No.1 PWD dated 02.01.1990, the Government have conducted meeting with various Engineering Associations, including the petitioner Association on 10.12.1996 and 03.06.1997 and took a decision to maintain 3:1 ratio between the direct recruitment and recruitment by transfer. As rightly pointed out, members of the petitioner Association are being considered for the number of vacancies apportioned as per the ratio out of total estimated vacancies. We have already referred to the of this Court dated 08.03.1991 in W.P.No.3309 of 1991, upholding the G.O.Ms.No.1 PWD dated 02.01.1990. It is also not in dispute that executive instructions can be issued to fill up the gap till necessary Rules are framed under Article 556 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 309 of the Constitution. All these and other materials have been correctly considered by the Tribunal; and we are in agreement with the conclusion arrived at by it.” 17. It can thus clearly be seen that the Division Bench of the Madras High Court held that G.O. No. 1 provided that from the date of the said , Junior Drafting Officer, Drafting Officer, Overseers and Technical Assistants, who have put in five years of service will be eligible to be appointed as Assistant Engineers by transfer of service on acquiring B.E./A.M.I.E. degree qualification. 18. It is sought to be urged that, before the Tribunal, the Technical Assistants had failed and that they had not challenged the said of the Tribunal. 19. However, we find that the Division Bench of the Madras High Court clearly referred to G.O.
