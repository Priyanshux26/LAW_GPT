Under these circumstances, the finding recorded by the Trial Court against issue No. 7 for dismissing the suit is found to be in . Hence, no case is made out to interfere with the dated 13/10/1999 passed by the Trial Court.” (underline supplied) 9. It is feeling aggrieved by the and decree of the First Appellate Court dated 09.04.2003 to the extent it is adverse to him 716 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports that the plaintiff-first respondent herein filed the S.A. No.401/2003 which culminated in the impugned . As noted hereinbefore, as per the impugned the High Court reversed the concurrent and decree of dismissal of the suit and allowed the same after setting them aside. After allowing the appeal under the impugned the suit of the plaintiff-first respondent herein was decreed on the following terms:- “(A) Plaintiff is entitled for recovery of possession of the suit land bearing Khasra No. 867/ 1, area 7.60 acres situated at village Mowa, Tahsil and District Raipur from the defendants No. 1 and 2; and it is directed that defendants shall deliver the vacant and peaceful possession of the Schedule suit land to the plaintiff herein.” 10. A scanning of the impugned of the High Court would reveal that the High Court virtually found that the appreciation of evidence by the courts below was perverse and on a proper appreciation of evidence on record felt that the plaintiff-first respondent herein had succeeded in establishing title over the suit land. Paragraphs 10 and 11 of the impugned assume relevance in the context of the challenge made against the sale by the appellants herein and they read thus: - “10. The Commissioner, by its dated 29th March, 1988 again confirmed the of Sub Divisional Officer, Raipur by dismissing the appeal filed by the defendants herein and declined to direct mutation in name of the defendants in the suit land. Thus, the document Ex.P-4 clearly recites the admission on the part of the defendants that the suit land is held by the plaintiff in his bhumiswami rights and to whom they cultivated the suit land for two consecutive years i.e. 1973 and 1974, not only this, defendants have clearly stated in document Ex.P-4 that they have cultivated the suit land only for more than two years. The date of the said document is 27.1.1981; and the instant civil suit has been filed on 24.12.1986. 11. Coming back to the sale deed (Ex.P-1) dated 4.6.1986 by which the plaintiff has purchased the suit land on 4.6.1986, which clearly recites that the delivery of possession by erstwhile owner Sitaram Agrawal in [2024] 10 S.C.R. 717 Neelam Gupta & Ors. v. Rajendra Kumar Gupta & Anr. favour of plaintiff coupled with the admission on the part of the defendants that the suit land was held by plaintiff only for the two consecutive years i.e. 1973 and 1974, they were in permissive possession of the suit land as Adhiyadar; therefore, it is held that the trial Court as well as first appellate Court have committed manifest illegality in holding that the plaintiff has failed to establish his title over the suit land.
