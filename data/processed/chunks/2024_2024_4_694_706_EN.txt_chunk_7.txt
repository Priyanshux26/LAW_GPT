11. It must be made clear that the compromise between the Plaintiff and Defendant no. 1 was arrived on 11.05.1978 and it was only the procedural requirements of XXIII Rule 3 of verifying and the [2024] 4 S.C.R. 705 Rehan Ahmed (D) Thr. Lrs. v. Akhtar Un Nisa (D) Thr. Lrs. compromise before the Court which were eventually completed on 09.05.1979. A perusal of the record of proceedings before the Trial Court reveals that verification of the terms of the compromise was attempted on 11.05.1978 but was not possible as Defendant No.1 was not present. Moreover, on subsequent dates being 11.5.1978, 24.07.1978, 31.01.1979 and 20.03.1979, either due to the illness of Defendant no.1 or due to the Presiding Officer not being present, there were various adjournments before the Trial Court. Finally, on 09.05.1979, Gulam Mohiuddin appeared before the Court and the parties submitted a fresh compromise application was filed because the earlier compromise application submitted on 11-05-1978 was not traceable on the record of the Court containing the same terms and conditions as in the compromise application earlier filed on 11.05.1978. The said application was also duly signed by both the parties. On the basis of the said compromise presented on 09.05.1979, the Trial Court took the compromise application on record, verified the fresh compromise application fulfilling all the terms and conditions of XXIII Rule 3 CPC. The terms and conditions of the compromise were read over to the parties and were accepted by them and the signatures of the parities were taken on the compromise application by the Court and thereafter the Court recorded its satisfaction on the compromise application, which is on the record of the Trial Court. The decree dated 09.05.1979 was passed based on this compromise. 12. As far as the terms of the compromise are concerned, which have also been questioned by the High Court, the agreement stipulated that Defendant No. 1 was to execute and register the sale deed in favor of the plaintiff by 01.07.1978, after receiving balance payment of Rs 25,000/-. The decree’s execution was contingent upon Defendant No. 1 fulfilling conditions such as obtaining the NOC and ensuring Defendant No. 2 vacating the portion of the property in question in his possession. The recording of the compromise and the consequent decree on 09.05.1979, although appearing procedurally delayed, adhered to the process required under CPC. 13. Furthermore, the High Court overlooked the fact that General Tarik, legal heir of Defendant No. 2, had previously objected to the execution proceedings, which was dismissed on 09.12.1988. Subsequent appeals before the High Court, including a Special Leave Petition to this Court, were also dismissed. Therefore, similar objections by Respondent No. 1, Smt. Akhtar Un Nisa, in her capacity as one of 706 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the legal heirs of Defendant No. 2 would not be maintainable and would amount to abuse of process of law. 14. In light of the reasons recorded above, this Court finds merit in the appellant-plaintiff’s argument and holds that the Executing Court had rightly rejected the objections under Section 47 CPC filed by Smt.
