Respondent No.1 emphasized that the acquisition would not only jeopardize his means of livelihood but also render him homeless. 5. Most of the other land-owners also objected to the acquisition of their lands primarily on the ground that such lands fell within ‘abadi deh’. The objections raised by Respondent No. 1, as well as by other landowners (respondents in connected matters), were to be adjudicated by the Collector. The notice fixing the date of hearing was forwarded to ‘interested persons’ through the Gram Pradhan, but the date of hearing was deferred on multiple occasions on the ground that only a few farmers came who also sought time to present their case(s). As a final opportunity, the matter was posted on 03.07.2014, when the Collector dismissed the objections and submitted a report under Section 5A(2) recommending for acquiring the subject land. 6. Following the rejection of objections, a declaration under Section 6(1) of the 1894 Act was issued on 14.01.2015, for acquiring 81.819 hectares of land. This declaration was also published in the daily newspapers “Amar Ujala” and “Dainik Jagran.” Subsequently, munadi was conducted on 16.02.2015. 7. Feeling aggrieved by the said declaration, Respondent No. 1 filed Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 36231/2015 before the High Court and sought quashing of the notifications issued under Section 4(1) and Section 6(1) of the 1894 Act. 8. During the pendency of the writ petition, the Collector passed an award on 17.06.2016, determining the total compensation for the acquired land to the tune of INR 2,21,79,27,378/- (INR 221.79 crores approximately). This was followed by the possession letters issued on 20.06.2016. 9. The High Court, vide impugned , scrutinized the procedural aspects of the proceedings conducted by the Collector in hearing objections filed under Section 5A. It has held that though the notices [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1009 New Okhla Industrial Development Authority v. Darshan Lal Bohra & Ors. to the affected land-owners were purportedly issued through the Gram Pradhan for informing the date of hearing, there was nothing on record to show how effectively the Gram Pradhan intimated all tenure holders. The High Court has consequently inferred that the respondent-landowners were not properly informed of the date of personal hearing. The High Court has also found fault with the Collector in consolidating the objections without adequate consideration and treating them as an empty formality. The High Court, in light of the fact that the Collector attempted to rectify his earlier by issuing a corrigendum, has also raised doubts on the fairness of the procedure. Consequently, the High Court has annulled the notification dated 14.01.2015, issued under Section 6(1) of the 1894 Act, with a direction that a fresh opportunity be given to the respondents and similarly situated tenure holders before proceeding further with the land acquisition process. 10. Discontented with the quashing of notification issued under Section 6(1) of the 1894 Act, NOIDA is in appeal before us. B. Contentions on behalf of NOIDA/State 11. Mr. Ravindra Kumar, learned senior counsel representing NOIDA and Mr. Ravindra Kumar Raizada, learned senior counsel and Additional Advocate General for the State of Uttar Pradesh, vehemently argued that the High Court erred in nullifying the notification dated 14.01.2015 issued under Section 6(1) of the 1894 Act.
