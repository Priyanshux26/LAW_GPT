PARDIWALA, J. ] SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT 7. Mr. Siddhartha Dave, the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant herein in his written submissions has stated as under:- “a) It is respectfully submitted that the Petitioner is not named in the present FIR but subsequently during the course of investigation he was named for the fi rst time in the statement of the alleged eye-witness Salman recorded under Section 161 CRPC on 12.08.2022, who gave an improved version of the alleged incident and on the basis of the said statement, vide G.D. Entry No. 30 dated 12.08.2022 the off ence under Sections 147, 148, 149, 195-A, 386, 504 and 506 IPC was added in the FIR No. 175/2022. It is pertinent to submit that nowhere in the FIR has the Complainant mentioned about the presence of the alleged eye-witness Salman at the time and place of incident. b) The allegations in the First Information Report are not only absurd but also highly improbable given that there is no mention of the date and time of incident in the FIR. Moreover apart from omnibus allegations there is no specifi c allegation against the accused persons. The Petitioner was not present at the time and place of the incident namely, Village Mirzapur, District Saharanpur, and in fact the Petitioner is permanently residing in Kunjagrant, Vikasnagar, Dehradun, Uttarakhand. c) It is respectfully submitted that the alleged First Information Report is absolutely false and frivolous, and on a reading of the said FIR, the off ence under Sections 147, 148, 149, 195-A, 386, 504 and 506 of IPC is clearly not made out against the Petitioner. The entire allegation in the FIR revolves around an earlier FIR No.122/2022 dated 21.06.2022 lodged by the Complainant against Haji Iqbal alias Bala (Petitioner’s father-in-law) and his family members under Sections 376, 323, 354 (A) IPC and Section 7 and 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Off ences Act, 2012. It is submitted that the Petitioner is not an accused in the said FIR No.122/2022 and there was therefore no question of the Petitioner having threatened the Complainant to withdraw the said FIR No.122 of 2022.
