H 904 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A 25.Section 16 prescribes punishment for committing terrorist act and terrorist act has been defined in Section 15 of the 1967 statute. We have reproduced these provisions earlier in this . 26. In none of the materials which have been referred to by the prosecution, the acts specified to in sub-clause (a) of Section 15(1) of B the 1967 Act can be attributed to the appellants. Nor there is any allegation against them which would attract sub-clause (c) of Section 15(1) of the said statute. As regards the acts specified in Section 15(1) (b) thereof, some of the literature alleged to have been recovered from the appellants, by themselves give hint of propagation of such activities. But there is nothing against the appellants to prima facie establish that they had C indulged in the activities which would constitute overawing any public functionary by means of criminal force or the show of criminal force or attempts by the appellants to do so. Neither there is allegation against them of causing death of any public functionary or attempt to cause death of such functionary. Mere holding of certain literatures through D which violent acts may be propagated would not ipso facto attract the provisions of Section 15(1)(b) of the said Act. Thus, prima facie, in our opinion, we cannot reasonably come to a finding that any case against the appellants under Section 15(1) (b) of 1967 Act can be held to be true. E 27.Section 17 of the 1967 Act deals with punishment for raising funds for terrorist acts. Here also the funds, dealing with which has been attributed to AF, cannot be connected to any terrorist act. In the case of Dr. Anand Teltumbde (supra) the same account statement was referred to. In respect of such allegations against Dr. Anand Teltumbde the Bombay High Court came to the following finding:- F “42. Mr. Patil has vehemently argued that this statement from the earlier letter supports receipt of monies i.e. Rs. 90,000/- by Anand T. (Appellant) from Surendra (accused No. 3) who was authorized to provide funds for future programmes. On careful reading of the earlier letter dated 02.01.2018 and G the aforementioned statement of account it is seen that there is a fallacy in the argument of NIA. Assuming that Anand T. is the Appellant himself and he received Rs. 90,000/- from Surendra through Milind, firstly it cannot be linked to the statement in the earlier letter dated 02.01.2018 since this account statement pertains to the year 2016 and or 2017. H VERNON v. THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA & ANR. 905 [ANIRUDDHA BOSE, J.] The document has a heading; viz; Party fund received in last A year from C.C. Last year would invariably mean the account of 2016 as the title of this document is “Accounts2K17” which would mean Accounts for 2017". That apart requiring us to presume that Anand T. is the Appellant would require further corroboration and evidence. prima facie it appears that, the B same has not been brought on record.
