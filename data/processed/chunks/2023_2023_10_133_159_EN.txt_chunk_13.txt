H M/S. SANVIRA INDUSTRIES v. RAIN CII CARBON (VIZAG) 151 LTD. & ORS. [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] (2) Consent issued by the concerned SPCB /PCC shall clearly A specify the quantity permitted for import and its use on a per month and per annum basis. (3) Only registered industrial units with valid consent from SPCBs/PCCs as per clause (1) shall be permitted to directly import pet coke and consignment shall be in the name of user B industrial units for their own use only. (4) Import of pet coke for the purpose of trading shall not be permitted. (5) Authorised importers of Petcoke shall furnish opening C and closing stock of imported Petcoke to the concerned SPCB/ PCC on a quarterly basis.” 21. As can be seen, the consent issued by the concerned SPCB or the PCC had to clearly state what was the capacity or quantity permitted for import by the concerned unit. In the present case, itis not disputed that the Consent to Operate (CTO) issued by APPCB in D Sanvira’s favor recorded the total capacity at 2,00,000 TPA. The copy of this CTO dated 24.04.2017 has been placed on record, which states as follows: E Interestingly, the same CTO also records as follows: “10. The industry shall not increase the capacity beyond the permitted capacity mentioned in this .” F 22. If one sees the disputes in terms of these facts, what is clear is that the CTO mentions Sanvira’s capacity at 2,00,000 TPA. Sanvira’s position is that the CTO for an additional 1,30,000 TPA was granted on 29.11.2018 and that the application for such capacity was made on 29.10.2018. It argued for the longest period (unsuccessfully) that though G the CTO for the increased capacity was issued on 29.11.2018, that capacity had in fact existed prior to that date. It relied heavily upon the Inspection Report, by its creditor - the State Bank of India and the report of the Inspecting Officer of the APPCB dated 03.10.2018. These facts were repeatedly mentioned and urged on several occasions H 152 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A including the two applications filed before this Court. Although the of this court is cast in general terms, the fact remains that a pointed reference to increased capacity was made on 08.07.2019 which rejected the claim for clarification. That claim for clarification was based upon Sanvira’s plea with respect to its increased production capacity to 3,30,000 TPA. B In its application I.A. No 73242/2019, Sanvira contended as follows: “(a) In September 2017 the applicant initiated capacity addition from 200,000 to 330,000 MTPA comprising of approximately furnaces having a capacity of 40,000 MTPA C each and expansion of power point_ capacity from 8 MW to 16 MW. (b) The total cost of capacity addition undertaken by the Applicant is Rs. 75 Crores, of which Rs. 50 Crores has been raised through a loan from EXIM Bank. Copy of loan sanction letter dated 03.01.2018 issuing by EXIM Bank is annexed D hereto and marked as Annexure A-4 (Pages 30-56).
