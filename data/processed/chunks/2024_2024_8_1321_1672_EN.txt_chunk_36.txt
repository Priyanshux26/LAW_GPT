Article 335 provides that the claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into consideration, consistently with the maintenance of efficiency of administration, in the making of appointments to services. The proviso to the Article states that the provision shall not prevent the “relaxation of qualifying marks in any examination or lowering the standards of evaluation”, for reservation of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in matters of promotion. 64. Reservations under Article 16(4) are not restricted to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The provision provides the State with the enabling power to provide reservations for the “backward classes” which are not adequately represented in the services of the State. The “backward class” encompasses more than the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. It encompasses all classes whose backwardness is attributable to social reasons.89 This includes other socially and educationally backward classes such as the Other Backward Class category, women and the disabled. 65. Applying the additional requirement of “efficiency of administration” only with respect to the exercise of power under Article 16(4) vis-à-vis the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes would be discriminatory. Reading this requirement into Article 16(4) assumes that a dilution of the principle of efficiency in administration is the necessary effect 86 Nagaraj v.

Rangachari, AIR 1962 SC 36; T Devadasan v. Union of India [1964] 4 SCR 680 [Justice Subba Rao, 32] 89 See Indra Sawhney v. Union of India (1992) Supp. 3 SCC 217 [116,117,492,788, 859(3)(e)] 1372 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of reservation for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes while the same standard is not applied to reservations for Other Backward Classes. Though this Court has not expressly stated so in as many words, efficiency of administration was added as a requirement for the exercise of power under Article 16(4) to prevent discrimination between the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes and other Socially and Educationally Backward Classes. If the requirement of efficiency of administration in Article 335 was not read into Article 16, then the requirement would only apply to reservations for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes but not for the reservation of other socially backward beneficiary classes.90 66. However, such an interpretative exercise (that is, applying the principle of efficiency of service to restrict the power of the State to provide affirmative action policies) is contrary to the express language of Article 335 which is confined to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. The preliminary error is that the requirement of efficiency of administration was viewed as an additional requirement and a roadblock to reservation provisions. Efficiency was not understood as a facet of the principle of equal opportunity. 67. The meaning of the phrase “efficiency” as it occurs in Article 335 must be determined to take this argument to its logical conclusion.
