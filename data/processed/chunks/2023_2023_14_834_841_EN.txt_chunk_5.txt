We have considered the submissions of learned counsel for the parties on the quantum of sentence. In our considered opinion, the ends of justice would be adequately met by converting the sentence of life imprisonment awarded to the appellant to rigorous imprisonment of ten years. The sentence as awarded by the courts below stands modifi ed accordingly. The appeal is allowed in part. The appellant shall be released on completion of the requisite and reduced period of sentence, if he is not required in any other case. 20. As a sequel thereto, pending interlocutory applications, if any, also stand disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal partly allowed. Ankit Gyan
