v. The Consortium of Mr. Murari Lal Jalan and Mr. Florian Fritsch & Anr. 21. Before this Court, the following three Interim s passed by the NCLAT came to be challenged by the Appellants over a period of time: i) Civil Appeal Nos. 3736-3737 of 2023 challenging the Interim dated 03.03.2023 passed by the NCLAT by which it declined to stay the NCLT dated 13.01.2023 which held that all the Conditions Precedent had been fulfilled; ii) Civil Appeal Nos. 4131-4134 of 2023 challenging the Interim dated 26.05.2023 passed by the NCLAT through which the NCLAT restrained the Appellants from invoking the PBG and extended the time for infusion of first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore up to 31.08.2023; and iii) Civil Appeal Nos. 6427-6428 of 2023 challenging the Interim dated 28.08.2023 passed by the NCLAT allowing the PBG of Rs. 150 Crore to be adjusted against the first tranche payment and allowing the remaining amount of Rs. 200 Crore to be infused by 30.09.2023. 22. All the aforementioned appeals were heard together and vide common and dated 18.01.2024, this Court held that the PBG cannot be permitted to be adjusted against the first tranche payment and therefore, directed that the amount of Rs. 150 Crore be infused in cash on or before 31.01.2024 (4th implementation extension). In the event of failure by Respondent No.1 to infuse the said amount within the said date, this Court held that the consequences under the Resolution Plan would follow. It disposed of the appeals as thus: “25. The lenders have argued in the appeals that there has been a failure on the part of the successful resolution applicant to comply with the conditions precedent. If the successful resolution applicant were to comply with the terms as envisaged in SBI's affidavit dated August 16, 2023, evidently issues pertaining to compliance with the conditions precedent were not to be pressed thereafter. In to furnish this successful resolution applicant a final opportunity to comply and consistent with the above position, we issue the following directions: (i) The successful resolution applicant shall peremptorily on or before January 31, 2024, deposit an amount of Rs. 150 crores into the designated account of SBI, failing 2084 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports which the consequences under the resolution plan shall follow; (ii) The performance bank guarantee of Rs. 150 crores shall continue to remain in operation and effect, pending the final disposal of the appeal before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, and shall abide by the final outcome of the appeal and the directions that may be issued by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal; and (iii) Whether or not the successful resolution applicant has been compliant with all the conditions of the resolution plan as well as of the conditions set out in paragraph 8 of the affidavit dated August 16, 2023 shall be decided by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal in the pending appeal.” (emphasis supplied) 23. Respondent No.1 failed to deposit Rs. 150 Crore in cash by 31.01.2024 as directed by this Court.
