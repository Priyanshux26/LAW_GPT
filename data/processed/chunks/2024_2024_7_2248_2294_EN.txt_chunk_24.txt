1210 of 2008 and First Appeal No. 6 of 2009 are set aside and will stand superseded by our present . No as to costs. II. Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 21611 of 2018 (Kazi Akiloddin Sujaoddin Vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors.) 74. Leave granted. 75. In this case, the facts are identical with Civil Appeal Nos. 6776-6777 of 2013. The question involved is about the payment of rental compensation for the period from 15.11.1998 (when the possession of the appellant’s land was taken) to 04.08.2000 (when the award was passed by the Land Acquisition Officer). After the Reference Court enhanced the compensation on 02.08.2008, the appellant and the State filed Appeals and cross Appeals in the High Court, namely, First Appeal No. 1210 of 2008 by the appellant and First Appeal No. 6 of 2009 by the State. Pending the Appeal in the High Court, the appellant applied to the 3rd respondent herein, the Special Land Acquisition officer, for grant of rental compensation on the basis of enhanced compensation awarded by the Reference Court by its dated 02.08.2008. Receiving no reply, the appellant filed Writ Petition No. 2763 of 2009 before the High Court. That Writ Petition was disposed off on 06.07.2009 by recording the statement of the Assistant Government Pleader that the application of the appellant would be decided on merits at the earliest. 76. Thereafter, on 05.10.2009, the application was rejected on the ground that of the Reference Court was under challenge before the High Court. 77. Aggrieved, the appellant filed Writ Petition No. 3883 of 2010. By the of 15.09.2011, Writ Petition No. 3883 of 2010 was allowed directing that enhanced rental compensation @ 8% of the [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2279 Kazi Akiloddin v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. enhanced amount as directed to be paid by the Reference Court, be deposited in the High Court. It further directed that the appellant could withdraw half the amount by furnishing the security and remaining amount to be kept in fixed deposit. It is undisputed that 8% was calculated for the period 15.11.1998 till the date of award i.e. 04.08.2000. 78. The State Government did not challenge the dated 15.09.2011 which determined the entitlement for rental compensation from 15.11.1998 (the date of taking advance possession) till 04.08.2000 (date of the award). The appellant, aggrieved by the of 15.09.2011 in Writ Petition 3883 of 2010, filed Civil Appeal No. 5084 of 2013 before this Court which was disposed off on 3rd July, 2013, directing that in case compensation is enhanced, the appellant shall be entitled for the rental compensation as per the enhanced amount. It did not interfere with the of the High Court directing the State Government to deposit the rental compensation @ of 8% of the amount awarded by the Reference Court with the Appellate Court and allowing the appellant to withdraw only half the amount. Liberty was also reserved to the appellant to claim proportionate higher rental compensation, if the of the Reference Court is upheld or further enhancement of compensation is made by the Appellate Court.
