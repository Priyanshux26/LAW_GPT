However, the prayer in the application was limited to post- 2006 retirees. In a second38 and third round39 of litigation, the Supreme Court directed all the State Governments to follow its dated D 08.10.2012 and directed revision of pension for those who retired post- 1996. By way of abundant caution, the Commission recommended that those States which have not granted this benefit to those who retired before 1996, must be given the same benefit. 92. The recommendation of the Commission is only in furtherance E of parity. State Governments have, in the past, been directed to undertake the consequential re-fixation before. However, if such consequential re- fixation has not been undertaken, the officers who had retired prior to 1996, and who would have aged significantly would be discriminated against. Such a situation ought to be avoided and thus the recommendation merits acceptance. This Court directs this recommendation to be F implemented immediately and without delay. V. Benefit of Years of Practice at the Bar while calculating pension (Recommendation no. 39.6) 93. After considering the s rendered by this Court in Government of NCT Delhi v All India Young Lawyers Association G (2009) 14 SCC 49, the Commission, recommended that the number of 38 dated 14.07.2016 in All India Judges Assn. v. Union of India in WP(C) No.1022/ 1989. 39 dated 13.03.2018 in All India Judges Assn. v. Union of India in WP(C) No.1022/ 1989. H 78 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A years of practice at the Bar subject to the maximum of weightage of 10 years shall be given while calculating pension and other retiral benefits. This Court in Government of NCT Delhi reasoned that this would be required as otherwise a direct recruit from the bar who becomes a District Judge would not be entitled to full pension. The recommendation, being the implementation of the of this Court, merits acceptance. It B is accordingly ed. VI. Recommendations on Family Pension (Recommendation Nos. 4.1 to 4.4) 94. As regards family pension, the Commission has not recommended any change in the existing percentage, i.e., 30% of the C last drawn pay. Therefore, this recommendation, as such, does not warrant any further deliberation as it is the mere continuation of the existing regime. The recommendation is accepted. 95. At the same time, the Commission has recommended payment of family pension @ 30% to the eligible family member after the death D of the spouse. This benefit has been given in light of Rule 54 CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972, which grants similar benefits to members of the central civil services. This recommendation is also thus accepted as it has been granted to members of the central civil services. 96. Obviously, the quantum of family pension must be increased E as per the same multiplier/index of rationalization applicable for pension. This is because the same factors which are applicable to pay and pension leading to their increase also equally apply to family pension. The Commission has also recommended the same. We accept the recommendation and direct that the quantum of family pension also worked out in the same manner as quantum of pension is worked out.
