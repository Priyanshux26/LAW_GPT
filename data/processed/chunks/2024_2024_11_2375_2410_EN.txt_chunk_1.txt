[Para 35.1] Specific Relief – Validity – Proof of Execution by Power of Attorney Holder – The Power of Attorney holder, M.K. Maheshwari, had personal involvement in the transaction, which was corroborated by an attesting witness and handwriting expert – The High Court made misplaced adverse inference from non-examination of other plaintiffs: Held: Valid execution established – The Court relied on Man Kaur v. Hartar Singh Sangha, (2010) 10 SCC 512 to affirm that a Power of Attorney holder with personal knowledge may validly depose – The Court distinguished the decision in Vidyadhar Vishnupant Ratnaparkhi v. Manikrao Babarao Deshmukh, (1999) 3 SCC 573, to argue adverse inference for non-examination of plaintiffs, on facts as the Power of Attorney holder had firsthand knowledge and testified credibly – The Supreme Court distinguished Janki Vashdeo v. IndusInd Bank, (2005) 2 SCC 217 and Rajesh [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2377 Shyam Kumar Inani v. Vinod Agrawal & Ors. Kumar v.

[Para 30] Pardanashin Status – No pleading or proof – Age/illiteracy – No seclusion – Voluntary execution – High Court assuming Sushila Devi to be a pardanashin lady, applied higher evidentiary threshold to the Agreement to Sell: Held: Sushila Devi not entitled to pardanashin protection – Presumption of undue influence not applicable – Burden of proof not discharged by defendants – The Supreme Court found no pleading or credible evidence to support such status – It distinguished Mst. Kharbuja Kuer v. Jangbahadur Rai, AIR 1963 SC 1203, relied on by respondents to invoke stricter scrutiny in transactions involving pardanashin women, on facts, as Sushila Devi’s status was not analogous due to the absence of seclusion or concealment – It also distinguished Krishna Mohan Kul v. Pratima Maity, (2004) 9 SCC 468 relied on to suggest incapacity due age and infirmity, on facts – Unlike the 100-year-old bedridden woman in that case, Sushila Devi was active and voluntarily executed the agreement.
