1 lacked locus standi in approaching the High Court. [Paras 12, 14, 15] Constitution of India – Art.226 – Toll charged to users of DND Flyway – Respondent No. 1 filed Writ Petition in High Court seeking direction to discontinue the toll – On facts, continuing cause of action – No delay or laches in filing the writ petition – Doctrine of Delay and Laches: Held: The contention regarding delay and laches in filing the writ petition is wholly misconceived and misdirected for the reason that, writ proceedings u/Art.32 or 226 are not guided by the provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963, but instead, by the Doctrine of Delay and Laches – It is ubiquitous that the doctrine of delay and laches cannot be applied stricto senso to writ petitions invoking public interest jurisdiction unless the court is satisfied that the party has not approached it with clean hands – While delay is a material factor there is no fixed period of limitation for invoking jurisdiction u/Art.226 and each case should be considered on its own facts and circumstances, thus allowing for a more liberal approach when applying this doctrine – The doctrine is not a rigid rule but is rather a practice that is founded on exercise of sound judicial discretion – Also, cause of action in the circumstances of the case [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1999 Noida Toll Bridge Company Ltd. v. Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Association and Others could have arisen and perhaps actually arose only after expiry of a reasonable period, within which cost of the Project was expected to be recovered – Further, levying of user fees or tolls by NTBCL constituted a continuing cause of action, which was challenged by the Association of affected commuters – Plea of delay and laches cannot be raised in a case of continuing cause of action. [Paras 17, 18, 20] Constitution of India – Art.226 – Toll charged to users of DND Flyway – Contract involving a State instrumentality – Scope of judicial intervention: Held:1. Judicial review, being a dynamic process as opposed to static, has experienced a significant shift in terms of the degree of judicial interference in contractual disputes, especially when one of the parties involved is the State or its instrumentalities – This is because when contractual power is exercised for public purposes, the State and its instrumentalities bear the responsibility to act fairly, without arbitrariness or caprice – In such situations, where State action is challenged as arbitrary or capricious, courts are justified in intervening through judicial review to determine whether the State has adhered to the principles embodied in Art.14 of the Constitution of India, which mandates fairness and non-arbitrariness in State actions – Considering that the Concession Agreement involves not only entities like IL&FS and NTBCL but also a Public Authority such as NOIDA, it is evident that the Concession Agreement, though commercial in nature, is subject to judicial scrutiny – This is particularly true given the public interest concerns raised by Respondent No.
