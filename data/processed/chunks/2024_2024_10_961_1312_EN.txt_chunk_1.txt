[Paras 217, 218] [2024] 10 S.C.R. 963 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 Ethos of s.6A, aligned with fraternity Constitution of India – Fraternity – Preambular notion of fraternity – Meaning of ‘fraternity’ – Ethos of s.6A, if aligned with fraternity – Preambular value of fraternity, if applicable to the immigrants entering into the State of Assam under the aegis of s.6A: Held: (per Surya Kant, J.) (for himself and for M.M. Sundresh and Manoj Misra, JJ.) Ethos underlying s.6A, align with the concept of fraternity – In the Indian constitutional context, fraternity assumes a dynamic and inclusive role, aligning with the broader goals of social justice, equality, and upliftment – Very scope of fraternity beyond just being an ideal in the Preamble was thus expanded to be a principle that would create checks and balances on the system of governance and state actions – Essence of fraternity, is fundamentally geared towards fostering interconnectedness among Indians and was envisaged to be a principle for uplifting marginalised sections of society – Petitioners approach to interpret fraternity in a highly restrictive manner, which allows them to choose their neighbours, cannot be accepted since it runs contrary to the very idea and ethos of fraternity envisaged by the Constituent Assembly and interpreted by this Court – Fraternity requires people of different backgrounds and social circumstances to ‘live and let live’ – Nomenclature of fraternity itself is self-explanatory to the extent that it exhibits the notion of inclusiveness and togetherness, as opposed to restricted applicability – Thus, it becomes imperative to refrain from employing this concept in a negative manner that selectively applies it to a particular segment while labelling another faction as ‘illegal immigrants’, solely based on the alleged unconstitutionality of s.6A.
