iii. Issue No. 3: Non-payment of Workmen and Employees’ dues 45. The ASG submitted that the Resolution Plan originally provides for a sum of Rs. 52 Crore towards the payment of workmen’s and employees’ dues. However, the NCLAT vide its dated [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2095 State Bank of India & Ors. v. The Consortium of Mr. Murari Lal Jalan and Mr. Florian Fritsch & Anr. 21.10.2022, in Para 78, had increased the same to Rs. 289.2 Crore which now stands modified to about Rs. 226 Crore. The NCLAT in the dated 21.10.2022 under Para 80 had observed in unambiguous terms that “the workmen are entitled to full payment of provident fund and gratuity, hence the balance of above dues ought to be paid by the SRA to satisfy statutory obligations. Non-payment of full provident fund and gratuity shall lead to violation of Section 30(2)(e) and hence, to save the Plan the above payments have to be made”. This view of the NCLAT had also been upheld by this Court vide its dated 30.01.2023. The Resolution Plan under Clause 6.3.1(c) obligates the payment of such dues within 180 days from the Effective Date. 46. It was submitted that, the NCLAT, vide Paras 111-114 had erroneously directed the payment of an amount of Rs. 12 Crore towards the Provident Fund and has completely ignored the payment of dues pertaining to gratuity of the workmen and employees. The Appellants contend that this finding is not only an error apparent but completely inconsistent with the NCLAT’s own earlier dated 21.10.2022, which stood upheld by this Court on 31.01.2023. iv. Issue No. 4: Achievement of Effective Date 47. It was submitted that Clause 7.6.2 of the Resolution Plan provided that the date of fulfilment of all the Conditions Precedent as stated in Clause 7.6.1, shall be the Effective Date for the purposes of the Resolution Plan. A failure to fulfill the Conditions Precedent within 270 days of the Approval Date would lead to an automatic withdrawal of the Resolution Plan as per Clause 7.6.4. However, the NCLT, vide its dated 22.06.2021, expressed its opinion that there was uncertainty with respect to the achievement of the Effective Date under the Resolution Plan and therefore, modified Clause 7.6.4. As a consequence, it fixed the Effective Date to be the 90th day from the Approval Date of 22.06.2021 and stated that this could be extended for a maximum period of another 180 days. The Effective Date, therefore, became 22.09.2021 i.e., 90 days from 22.06.2021. Subsequently, three extensions were given to the SRA with respect to the achievement of the Effective Date – First, vide dated 29.09.2021, the NCLT extended it to 22.12.2021; Secondly, vide dated 20.01.2022, the NCLT extended to 22.03.2022 through which the maximum extension of 270 days that 2096 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports could be provided under the Resolution Plan had been reached and; Thirdly, vide dated 11.04.2022, the NCLT further extended it to 25.05.2022 by excluding a period of 65 days spent in moving the application for grant of time.
