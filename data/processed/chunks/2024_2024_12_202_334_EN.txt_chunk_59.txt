In any event, these discussion are academic in the light of the validation in Section 97 of the Finance Act, 2022. 273. It must also be remembered that the “Officers of Customs” in Section 3(1)(a) to (h) of the Customs Act, 1962 (as amended under Section 3(1) (a) to (j) after 2022 amendment) are Officers from Group ‘A’ Cadre of the Customs Department (IRS) like their counterparts from 294 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the Central Excise Department as Central Tax Officers under GST. 274. A reading of Section 2(34) with Section 4 of the Customs Act, 1962 also makes it clear that the expression “proper officer” means the “Officer of Customs” who has been assigned those functions either by the Board or by the Principal Commissioner of Customs or by Commissioner of Customs in relation to any function to be performed under the Act. 275. Notifications which have been issued to appoint these officers from Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) to act as “Proper Officers” are enabling Notification notwithstanding the fact that they are already “Officers of Customs” under Notification issued under Section 4(1) of the Customs Act,1962. 276. Further, the Board can also authorize the Principal Commissioner of Customs or Chief Commissioner of Customs or Principal Chief Commissioner or Commissioner of Customs or Joint or Assistant or Deputy Commissioner of Customs, to appoint Officers of Customs below the rank of Assistant Commissioner of Customs. Thus, the following Group ‘B’ Executive - Gazetted and Non-Gazetted Officers assist in the initial stage of assessment of goods as:- Sl. No. Group ‘B’ Executive Group ‘B’ Executive Gazetted Officer Non – Gazetted Officer 1 Superintendent of Preventive Officers Customs (Preventive) (Customs) 2 Appraiser of Customs Examiner (Customs) 277. As mentioned above, assessment is neither by the Group ‘B’ Executive – Gazetted Officer nor by Group ‘B’ Executive – Non-Gazetted Officer after 08.04.2011. Only, prior to 08.04.2011, the assessment of goods at the port was vested with the Group ‘B’ Executive – Gazetted Officer. However, after the said date, the fundamental of assessment has undergone a sea change and changed permanently as mentioned above. [2024] 12 S.C.R. 295 Commissioner of Customs v. M/s Canon India Pvt. Ltd. 278. These fundamental changes brought to the manner of the assessment under the Customs Act, 1962 with effect from 08.04.2011 appear to have not been brought to the attention of the Hon’ble Supreme Court and therefore the assumption in the paragraph Nos.12 to 15 in the case of Canon India Private Limited Vs. Commissioner of Customs, 2021 (376) E.L.T.3(S.C.) may require a re-consideration insofar as pending cases before the Hon’ble Supreme Court and other Courts.” [Emphasis supplied] 127. Mr. N. Venkataraman, the Ld. ASG is correct in his submission that the distinction sought to be made between Section 5 and Section 6 of the Act, 1962 (powers and duties vis-à-vis functions) could be said to be imaginary and may have very serious legal implications. 128. The assignment of functions of the proper officer for the purposes of any section under the Act to an officer of customs is expressly mentioned in Section 2(34).
