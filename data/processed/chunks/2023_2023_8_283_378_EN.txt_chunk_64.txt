As we have pointed out in the C beginning, the applicant-Society has come up with three applications, praying respectively (i) forleave to get impleaded; (ii) to implead in appeals arising out of SLP (C) Nos.2373-2377 of 2020; and (iii) for appropriate clarification that the observations in the impugned are not applicable to the land in Survey No.163. In other words, D what the applicant-Society wants us to do, is to clarify a of the High Court. We do not know under what provision of law this Court can clarify the of a High Court through an application taken out in a pending appeal, especially in a matter of this nature. By filing these E applications in the appeals filed by their predecessors-in- title, the applicant-Society is either trying to piggyback ride on their vendors or to wriggle their predecessors in title, out of trouble. This cannot be permitted; and (iii) In any event, the applicant-Society has admittedly filed a F petition for review of the impugned on the ground that the same cannot affect their rights in Survey No.163. Therefore, it is not open to the applicant-Society to come up before us and that too in the form of an application for direction. Hence these three IAs deserve to be dismissed. Accordingly, they are dismissed. G CONCLUSION 226.
