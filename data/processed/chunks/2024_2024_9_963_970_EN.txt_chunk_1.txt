Whether, by virtue of Section 5(2) (a), upon publication of the Notification under Section 4 of the Consolidation Act, any pending civil suit for cancellation of a sale deed executed by fraud and impersonation, stands abated and the jurisdiction of the Civil Court to try such a suit is ousted in terms of Section 49 of the Consolidation Act? 3. The Petitioners-Defendants, assail the correctness of the dated 02.08.2019, passed by the High Court of Uttarakhand, whereby Writ Petition (M/S) No. 93/2019, filed by the Respondent-Plaintiff was allowed holding that a suit for cancellation of a “voidable” sale deed relating to agricultural land pending in a Civil Court would not stand abated in terms of Section 5(2) (a) of the Consolidation Act and the bar on jurisdiction of the Civil Court’s under Section 49 of the Consolidation Act would not be applicable when the suit is for cancellation of a “voidable document”; as opposed to a “void document”. 4.
