[Paras 8.3, 21.2(a)] Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 – ss.13(1)(d)/ 13(2) – Penal Code, 1860 – s.120-B r/w. ss.409/420 – Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act, 1957 – Could the Audit Report of the CAG fasten any liability on KECML: Held: The Supreme Court having already dismissed the appeal filed by KPCL against the of the Karnataka High Court, having held in clear terms that the CAG Report could not form the basis for launching proceedings against the appellants and further, having upheld the findings returned by the Karnataka High Court that the CAG Report appears to have been the starting point for the entire disputes between the parties who till then, were smoothly discharging their obligations under various agreements, there is no reason to take a different view only on the ground that the 1148 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports respondent-CBI was not a party in the aforesaid proceedings – Further, the CAG Report had not attained finality inasmuch as its recommendations have not been tabled before the Parliament or accepted so far – The said report at best, has a persuasive value but no more. [Paras 9.5, 21.2(b)] Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 – ss.13(1)(d)/13(2) – Penal Code, 1860 – s.120-B r/w. ss.409/420 – Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act, 1957 – What is the import of the dated 24.03.2016 of the Karnataka High Court: Held: The decision dated 24.03.2016 of the Karnataka High Court in a writ petition filed by KECML against KPCL has been wrongly overlooked – The High Court had an occasion to scrutinize the very same agreements and the CAG report that formed the basis of the investigation conducted by the respondent- CBI to return positive findings in favour of the appellants – The view taken by the Karnataka High Court has been upheld by this Court in a rendered on 20.05.2022 which was just a few days after Charges were framed by the Special Judge, CBI on 03.03.2022. [Para 21.2(f)] Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act, 1957 – What is the sanctity of an Audit Report in Law: Held: The CAG Report is subject to scrutiny by the Parliament and the Government can always offer its views on the said report – Merely because the CAG is an independent constitutional functionary does not mean that after receiving a report from it and on the PAC scrutinizing the same and submitting its report, the Parliament will automatically accept the said report – The Parliament may agree or disagree with the Report – It may accept it as it is or in part – In the instant case, it is not in dispute that the Audit Report of the CAG has not been tabled before the Parliament for soliciting any comments from the PAC or the respective Ministries – Therefore, the views taken by the CAG to the effect that tremendous loss had been caused to the public exchequer on account of the coal rejects being disposed of by the KPCL and KECML remains a view point but cannot be accepted as decisive – The respondent-CBI has largely relied on the findings and the conclusions drawn in the Audit Report of the CAG to launch the prosecution against the appellants on an assumption that the said Report has the seal of approval of the Parliament and has attained finality, which is not the case.
