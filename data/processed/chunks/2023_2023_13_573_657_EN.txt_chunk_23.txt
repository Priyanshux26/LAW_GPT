Hence, she was issued with the summons for appearing and explaining the same. However, she chose to ignore the summons and has not appeared before the adjudicating authority. Whereas, the factory in-charge and manager, Shri Dipak S Shah, has appeared and has furnished the statement, whereunder he admits that he reports to Smt. Sheetal K Majithia, Director – Finance. He further admits in his statement dated 26.06.2007 and 09.07.2007, that their/assessee’s product is classifi able as ‘jarda/zarda scented tobacco,’ they still continued to pay duty as per MRP-based assessment prescribed under Section 4A of the CE Act. He further admits at the material time 2005-06, the product manufactured by them was described as ‘jarda/zarda scented tobacco’ and was known and sold in the market as ‘jarda/zarda scented tobacco’, which was also described in their invoices accordingly. He has categorically admitted in his statement that from April 2006 onwards the assessee started describing their product as ‘chewing tobacco’ for availing the benefi t of Notifi cation of 2 of 2006 dated 01.03.2006, which undisputedly did not continue to refl ect ‘jarda/zarda scented tobacco’. In this background, when the communication dated 30.03.2006 to the Department intimating the change of classifi cation is perused, it would indicate the details of the products which was being manufactured was not specifi ed in the said communication at all. In that view of the matter, the communication relied upon by the assessee would pale into insignifi cance. ` 46. The label of the product manufactured by the appellant is “Baghban Zafrani Zarda” and below the label it is indicated as “fl avoured chewing COMMR. OF CEN. EXC. AHMEDABAD v. M/S URMIN 605 PRODUCTS P. LTD. AND OTHERS [ARAVIND KUMAR, J.] tobacco.” It has been the consistent stand of the assessee that the expression “zarda/jarda” in the tariff entry is diff erent from the term “zarda/jarda” used by the appellant. It is nobody’s case that there was a change in the label or manufacturing process from the six (6) digit era to the eight (8) digit tariff era. The tribunal itself seems to have been in dilemma and has been swayed by the fact that no expert opinion had been obtained by the Department for classifi cation. This situation would not arise at all for reasons more than one, fi rstly, the assessee itself right from the beginning has been consistently declaring the product manufactured by it as ‘chewing tobacco’ till the 8-digit regime in 2005 (w.e.f. 24.02.2005) sub-classifi ed the entries as ‘chewing tobacco’ and ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’. In the ER-I returns fi led from March 2005 till April 2006 i.e., after the sub-classifi cation, the assessee mentioned the description of the product as ‘zarda scented tobacco’ and from April 2006 reclassifi ed it as ‘chewing tobacco’. 47. At the cost of repetition it requires to be noticed that the Notifi cation No. 2 of 2006 dated 01.03.2006 was issued in supersession of Notifi cation 13 of 2002 dated 01.03.2002 specifying the goods covered under Section 4A of the CE Act, for MRP based assessment.
