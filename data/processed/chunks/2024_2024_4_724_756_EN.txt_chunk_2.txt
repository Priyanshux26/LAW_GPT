[Paras 41, 42] Evidence Act, 1872 – Burden of proof and onus of proof – Distinction between: Held: There is an essential distinction between burden of proof and onus of proof; burden of proof lies upon a person who has to prove the fact and which never shifts but onus of proof shifts – Such a shifting of onus is a continuous process in the evaluation of evidence – For instance, in a suit for possession based on the title, once the plaintiff has been able to create a high degree of probability so as to shift the onus on the defendant, it is for the defendant to discharge his onus and in the absence thereof, the burden of proof lying on the plaintiff shall be held to have been discharged so as to amount to proof of the plaintiff’s title. [Para 43] Evidence – Burden of proof – Insurance contracts – Non- disclosure of a material fact: Held: In the context of insurance contracts, the burden is on the insurer to prove the allegation of non-disclosure of a material fact and that the non-disclosure was fraudulent – Thus, the burden of proving the fact, which excludes the liability of the insurer to pay compensation, lies on the insurer alone and no one else. [Para 45] Word and Phrases – Contra proferentem rule: Held: In United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Orient Treasures (P) Ltd., (2016) 3 SCC 49, the Supreme Court quoted Halsbury’s Laws of England (5th Edn. Vol. 60, Para 105) on the contra proferentem rule – Where there is ambiguity in the policy the court will apply the contra proferentem rule – Where a policy is produced by the insurers, it is their business to see that precision and clarity are attained and, if they fail to do so, the ambiguity 728 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports will be resolved by adopting the construction favourable to the insured. [Para 40] Case Law Cited Manmohan Nanda v. United India Insurance Co. Ltd.
