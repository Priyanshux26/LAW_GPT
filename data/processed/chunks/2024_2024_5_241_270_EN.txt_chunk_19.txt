The 1952 Act that occupies the field in the present case has undisputedly received Presidential assent and hence it prevails over the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 so far as the state of Rajasthan is concerned.37 30. This Court in VVS Rama Sharma (supra) did not consider any such law enacted by the state legislature that received Presidential assent and was applicable within the state over the central Act. Further, a stamp duty is a tax,38 and hence under Article 26539, its levy and collection must be by the ‘authority of law’40. In VVS Rama Sharma (supra), there was no charging provision that was considered by the Court that required the payment of stamp duty on insurance policies to the government of UP. Rather, the case was concerned with the interpretation of Rules framed by the state under the central Act. Hence, the final conclusion in that case is differentiable on facts and law from the present case. 31. Conclusions on this issue: We have undertaken a detailed analysis of the provisions of the 1952 Act and the Rajasthan Stamp Rules, 1955 that impose stamp duty on insurance policies issued by the appellant within the state. Section 3 of Indian Stamp Act, 1899 as adapted to the state of Rajasthan is the charging provision as per which the appellant must pay stamp duty to the state government on insurance policies executed within the state. The rate at which stamp duty is payable on policies of insurance under the 1952 Act has been adopted from Schedule I of the central Act, in accordance with Entry 91 of List I. The charging provision has thus been validly enacted by the state government under Entry 44 of List III. Therefore, the state government in the present case can impose stamp duty on the issuance 37 UP Electric Supply Co Ltd v. R.K. Shukla [1970] 1 SCR 507 : (1969) 2 SCC 400, para 9; M. Karunanidhi v.

Taxes not to be imposed save by authority of law.—No tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law.” 40 Balaji v.

The State of Rajasthan and Ors. of insurance policies within its territory and require the payment of such stamp duty by the appellant. Under these circumstances, the commencement of proceedings for recovery of stamp duty under the state law and the rules made thereunder is legal, valid, and justified. IV. Liability of the Appellant in the Facts of the Present Case: 32. The learned ASG has relied on the letter by the Treasury Officer, Jaipur dated 07.10.1991, the contents of which have been extracted hereinunder: “In reference to above it is to submit that Government of India Insurance Stamp is the property of Central Government, whose supply and distribution is not related with this Department.” 33.
