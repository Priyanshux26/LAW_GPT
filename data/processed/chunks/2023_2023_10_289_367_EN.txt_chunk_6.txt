Thus E all individuals domiciled in Sikkim till 26th April, 1975 and who have since become citizens of India are entitled to exemption from payment of income tax as per Section 10 (26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961. [Paras 73 and 74][364-D-G] 5. Only such individuals are entitled to the exemption who F fall within the three clauses of the Explanation. Hence, the Explanation must be construed strictly as it is in the nature of a definition of the expression “Sikkimese” for the purpose of granting an exemption from payment of income tax under the I.T. Act, 1961. However, the exemption must be extended to incorporate all such individuals who have been domiciled in G Sikkim as on 26th April, 1975 and who have since then become citizens of India. This would mean that all other citizens of India who do not fall within the ambit of the Explanation as interpreted above and who have been domiciled in Sikkim State subsequent to 26th April, 1975 would not have the benefit of exemption under H Section 10 (26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961. Thus, any individual ASSOCIATION OF OLD SETTLERS OF SIKKIM AND ORS. v. 297 UNION OF INDIA AND ANR. not falling within the said clause would not be entitled to the said A exemption. This would however be discriminatory insofar as those settlers in Sikkim are concerned who have been domiciled in Sikkim subsequent to promulgation of 1961 Regulation and till 26th April, 1975 when Sikkim merged with India. Such individuals are old settlers who have become citizens of India from 26th April, B 1975 but who were domiciled in Sikkim prior to the said date. They are also entitled to the exemption under Section 10 (26AAA). Hence, directions in that regard have to be issued to fill the Legislative vacuum and amendment to the Explanation is necessary. However, those individuals who have been domiciled in Sikkim subsequent to 26th April, 1975 shall not be entitled to C the benefit of exemption from payment of income tax. [Paras 75 and 76][364-H; 365-A-B; D-F] 6. This Court has on previous occasions, sought to enforce rights of citizens even in areas of legislative vacuum. To this end, Article 142 of the Constitution of India has been invoked and the D law so declared in to fill the vacuum has been treated as law declared by this Court under Article 141 until a proper legislation is made. [Para 77; 365-G] 7.1 The Union of India shall make an amendment to Explanation to Section 10 (26AAA) of I.T. Act, 1961, so as to E suitably include a clause to extend the exemption from payment of income tax to all Indian citizens domiciled in Sikkim on or before 26th April, 1975. The reason for such a direction is to save the explanation from unconstitutionality and to ensure parity in the facts and circumstances of the case. [Para 79; 367-B] 7.2 Till such amendment is made by the Parliament to the F Explanation to Section 10 (26AAA) of I.T.
