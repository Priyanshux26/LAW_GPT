This decision has been followed by the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Taulis Pharma Ltd. v. Bengal Immunity Ltd., [2002] 108 Comp. Cas. 237. Similar views have also been expressed in Vibgyar Ink Chem (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Safe Pack Polymers Ltd., [1998] 93 Com. Cas. 407, which likewise is a decision of the Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court which enunciates that “an independent transaction de hors the scheme obviously cannot thus be covered within the ambit of Section 22 of the 1985 Act”. 9. Justice Lahoti’s view has also been followed by a Single Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Fort William Industries Limited v. Usha Bentron Limited, [2002] 108 Comp. Cas. 176. His Lordship, Dr. Mukundakam Sharma, J. has, in the Cement Corporation of India v. Manohar Basin, 82 (1999) DLT 343 : 1999 (51) DRJ 535 observed that since no documentary proof had been furnished to disclose that any scheme stood sanctioned the so-called SICA bar was not attracted. A Single Bench of the Bombay High Court in Special Steels v. Jay Prestressed Products Ltd., [1991] 72 Comp. Cas. 277 has opined that the pivotal question in connection with the current conundrum concerns the assets of the Company and its functioning, and these would not be jeopardized if a civil suit continues. In Hardip Singh v. Income Tax Officer, Amritsar, [1979] 118 ITR 57 (SC) the winding-up petition was allowed to continue and only when the third and final stage of the dissolution of the Company came to be reached, was the moratorium of Section 22 of the SICA enforced.” (Emphasis supplied) 90. The original plaintiff has placed strong reliance upon the decision of a single judge of the Delhi High Court in Sunil Mittal (supra). It was held therein that since the liability was neither admitted nor taken into consideration by any rehabilitation scheme, the suit proceedings [2024] 5 S.C.R. 371 Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v. M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited could not have been adjourned sine die under Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act. The relevant paragraphs are extracted hereinbelow: “21. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, I feel as the FChas not admitted its liability to pay the amount to the tune as claimed by the plaintiff nor such an amount has been reckoned or taken into consideration by any scheme of rehabilitation of the sick defendant company, therefore, the proceedings of the present suit cannot be adjourned sine die. As a matter of fact the defendant has not placed on record any documentary evidence to show that any such scheme has been formulated as yet and if formulated whether the said amount has been taken care of allegedly being owed to the Plaintiff. 22. For the aforesaid reasons, I feel that the application of the Defendant totally misconceived and accordingly, the same is dismissed.” (Emphasis supplied) 91. It has come to our notice that the said decision in Sunil Mittal (supra) was challenged in appeal before a division bench of the Delhi High Court in LML Ltd. v. Sunil Mittal reported in 2013 SCC OnLine Del 1766 wherein the bench set aside the decision and held that Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act would apply to the facts of the case.
