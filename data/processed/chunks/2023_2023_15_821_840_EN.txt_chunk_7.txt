CONSIDERATION BY THIS COURT 8. The term “Court” is not defi ned under the Code. What it does defi ne is a decree and an in Section 2(2) and Section 2(14) respectively. The said defi nitions are extracted below. “Section 2(2) “Decree” means the formal expression of an adjudication which, so far as regards the Court expressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit and may be either preliminary or fi nal. It shall be deemed to include the rejection of a plaint and the determination of any question within 1*** section 144, but shall not include. (a) any adjudication from which an appeal lies as an appeal from an , or (b) any of dismissal for default. Explanation. A decree is preliminary when further proceedings have to be taken before the suit can be completely disposed of. It is fi nal when such adjudication completely disposes of the suit. It may be partly preliminary and partly fi nal.” 18 (2013) 4 SCC 52 19 (2020) 14 SCC 210 832 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. “Section 2(14) “” means the formal expression of any decision of a Civil Court which is not a decree.” 9. The Indian Evidence Act, 1872 defi nes the word “Courts” as under:- “3…..“Court”.––“Court” includes all Judges and Magistrates, and all persons, except arbitrators, legally authorised to take evidence.” However, this Court in State of M.P v. Anshuman Shukla20 while referring to a of the Calcutta High Court21 observed that the defi nition under the said Act is not exhaustive, but all authorities authorized to take evidence must be held to be courts under the meaning of said provision. 10. In P. Sarathy v. SBI22 this Court has observed “13. The Court referred to the earlier decisions in Bharat Bank Ltd. v. Employees [1950 SCC 470 : AIR 1950 SC 188 : 1950 SCR 459] ; Maqbool Hussain v. State of Bombay [AIR 1953 SC 325 : 1953 SCR 730] and Brajnandan Sinha v. Jyoti Narain [AIR 1956 SC 66 : (1955) 2 SCR 955] . The Court approved the rule laid down in these cases that in to constitute a court in the strict sense of the term, an essential condition is that the court should have, apart from having some of the trappings of a judicial tribunal, power to give a decision or a defi nitive which has fi nality and authoritativeness which are the essential tests of a judicial pronouncement.” 11. Article 116 of the Limitation Act provides the period of limitation for an appeal, a) to a High Court i.e., 90 days from the date of /decree; and b) to any other court from an , 30 days from the date of /decree. 12. The Claimant - Appellants contend that this court in Vidyacharan Shukla (supra) is clearly distinguishable from the present dispute. In the said case, inter alia, the court was faced with a statute (Representation of Peoples Act, 1951), to which the Court has been made expressly applicable, whereas the same is not the case here.
