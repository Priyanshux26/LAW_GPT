Eventually, Accused No. 04 is also said to have been arrested on 26.06.2000 and per his statement under Section 67 of the NDPS Act 1985 he had confessed to be transporting and selling the contraband which he sold regularly to Accused No. 05. 8. Eventually, the charges were framed and a total of five prosecution witnesses were examined with PW-01 being one of the panch witnesses, PW-02 to PW-04 being members of the raiding party, and PW-05 being the FSL expert. Per contra, the defence had examined a total of seven witnesses in their favour. 9. The trial of Accused No. 01 to Accused No. 05 was concluded by the Additional Sessions Judge in Sessions Case No. 143 of 2000 and Sessions Case No. 295 of 2000 vide dated 28.01.2004, whereby while the Accused No. 02 and Accused No. 03 were acquitted, Accused No. 01, Accused No. 04 and Accused No. 05 were convicted as aforementioned. 9A.
