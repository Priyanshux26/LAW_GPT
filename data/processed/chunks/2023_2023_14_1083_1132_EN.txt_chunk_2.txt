[Paras 57, 60, 66] Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 – Short-coming in the implementation – Non- constitution of various institutions required for implementation of the Act: 108 6 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. Held: A major short-coming in the implementation of the 2013 Act is the fact that the State and the Central Governments have not even constituted the various institutions required to implement the Act– Implementation of the statute depends on the eff ective functioning of the institutions like National Commission for Safai Karamcharis, State Commission for Safai Karamcharis, Central Monitoring Committee, State Monitoring Committee, Vigilance Committees, State/District Level Survey Committee – Unfortunately, these institutions have not been constituted by the States and the Union and where they have been constituted, the institutions are not functioning at all – The Act has created the institutions to ensure a check and balance on the implementation of the statute – However, instead of being a check on the implementation, the lack of institutions has eff ectively brought the implementation of the Act to a total stand-still – Functioning of each of the institutions dealt with specifi cally. [Paras 67, 68] Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 – Manual scavenging and hazardous cleaning, separately treated under the 2013 Act – Plea that this violates Article 14 as there is no rational diff erentiation between the two: Held: This court is not faced with a challenge to the statute – Without a challenge to the provisions, the diff erentiation cannot be held unconstitutional – Constitution of India – Article 14. [Para 82] Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 – Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Rules, 2013 – rr.3, 5 – Mechanization of hazardous cleaning through ‘cleaning devices’ and ‘protective gear’ – Exceptions – Discussed. Constitution of India – Article 23 – Status of hazardous cleaning u/Article 23 – Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act, 2013: Held: Article 23 prohibits forced labour and makes it an off ence punishable in accordance with law – The expression ‘other forms of forced labour’ in Article 23 strike at all forms of labour which off end human dignity – This would include not just remuneration but would also include all labour where the absolute minimum standards of safe employment are not met – DR. BALRAM SINGH v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 1087 Where minimum protective gear and cleaning devices are not provided to hazardous workers, the employment of hazardous workers amounts to forced labour and is thus prohibited under the Constitution – The provisions for protective gear and cleaning devices are not mere statutory rights or rules, but are entitlements and it is due to these entitlements that the provisions of the 2013 Act are in consonance with the Constitution – A contract for employment of a hazardous cleaner without protective gear and cleaning devices would violate Article 23 even if it were voluntary because such an agreement would violate human dignity.
