[2023] 2 S.C.R. 511 511 YOGESH UPADHYAY AND ANR. A v. ATLANTA LIMITED (Transfer Petition (Criminal) Nos. 526-527 of 2022) FEBRUARY 21, 2023 B [DINESH MAHESHWARI AND SANJAY KUMAR, JJ.] Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – ss.138, 142(1) – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.406 – Transfer of criminal cases – Power of Supreme Court – Held: Notwithstanding the non-obstante C clause in s.142(1), the power of Supreme Court to transfer criminal cases u/s.406, Cr.P.C. remains intact in relation to offences u/s.138, if it is found expedient for the ends of justice – In the present case, as the six complaint cases filed by the respondent (four before the Dwarka Courts at New Delhi and two before the Courts at Nagpur, Maharashtra) pertain to the same transaction, it would be advisable D to have a common adjudication to obviate the possibility of contradictory findings being rendered in connection therewith by different Courts – Cases pending before the Courts at Nagpur, Maharashtra transferred to the Dwarka Courts at New Delhi – Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Act, 2015 – ss. 142(2), 142- E A. Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – ss.138, 142(2)(a) – Held: s.142(2)(a) vests jurisdiction for initiating proceedings for an offence u/s.138 in the Court where the cheque is delivered for collection, i.e., through an account in the branch of the bank where F the payee or holder in due course maintains an account – Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Act, 2015. Words & Phrases – Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 – s.142(2) – ‘shall be inquired into and tried only by a Court within whose local jurisdiction……’ – Discussed. G Allowing the transfer petitions, the Court HELD: 1.1 Perusal of the Statement of Objects and Reasons in Amendment Act 26 of 2015 makes it amply clear that insertion of Sections 142(2) and 142-A in the Act of 1881 was a direct consequence of the of this Court in Dashrath H 511 512 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A Rupsingh Rathod. Therefore, the use of the phrase: ‘shall be inquired into and tried only by a Court within whose local jurisdiction……’in Section 142(2) of the Act 1881 is contextual to the ratio laid down in Dashrath Rupsingh Rathod to the contrary, whereby territorial jurisdiction to try an offence under Section 138 of the Act of 1881 vested in the Court having jurisdiction B over the drawee bank and not the complainant’s bank where he had presented the cheque. Section 142(2) now makes it clear that the jurisdiction to try such an offence would vest only in the Court within whose jurisdiction the branch of the Bank where the cheque was delivered for collection, through the account of C the payee or holder in due course, is situated. The newly inserted Section 142-A further clarifies this position by validating the transfer of pending cases to the Courts conferred with such jurisdiction after the amendment.
