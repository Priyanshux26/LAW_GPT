34. Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, learned ASG for the Union of India and Mr. Naresh Kaushik, learned counsel for the Respondent No.3-UPSC, thoroughly and painstakingly countered the submissions of the petitioners. According to the learned counsel, the present was a case where there was a clear prescription in the form of rules. Learned counsel relied on OM dated 19.01.2019, 31.01.2019 & Rule 13, 27 & 28of the CSE-2022 Rules to contend that eligibility is acquired as an EWS candidate only after the candidate meets the criteria issued by the Central Government and is in possession of the requisite I&AC based on the income for F.Y. 2020-2021; that under Rule 28, the candidates should be in possession of all the requisite certifi cates in the prescribed format in support of their claim by the closing date of the application viz. 22.02.2022; that for the Main Examination, a candidate is required to submit DAF-I along with scanned documents in support within prescribed time for the same; any delay in submission of the DAF-I or documents in support beyond the prescribed date was not allowed and would lead to cancellation of the candidature. Learned counsel distinguished the cases of Charles K. Skaria (Supra), Dolly Chhanda (supra) and Dheerender Singh Paliwal (supra) by stating that in those cases the candidates, who were given relief, possessed the eligibility before the cut-off date and the issue was only about submission of proof. Learned counsel relied on Ashok Kumar Sharma and Others vs. Chander Shekhar and Another (1997) 4 SCC 18 and Union Public Service Commission vs. 62 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. Gaurav Singh & Ors. [C.A. No. 4152 of 2022 decided on 18.05.2022] to reinforce their submissions and distinguished the case of Deepak Yadav (supra) as having been confi ned to its special facts for the extraordinary COVID year. Learned counsel submitted that Ram Kumar Gijroya (supra) case was also clearly distinguishable and that the petitioners could not derive any benefi t from it. 35. Learned counsel contend that the petitioners should be estopped from challenging the validity of the selection process since they have participated in the selection. 36. Learned counsel contend that the explanation given for not obtaining the certifi cate between 01.04.2021 and 21.02.2022 by the writ petitioner (Divya) in W.P. (C) No. 724 of 2023 is completely untenable. Learned counsel for the UPSC drew our attention to the fact that the petitioner had, during the heightened pandemic, obtained certifi cate for the year 2019-2020 on 09.10.2020. Learned counsel reiterated his submissions in the counter affi davit and in the additional affi davit and submitted that the selection process being over, the cadre being allocated and the personnel having been deputed for training, to interfere at this stage would result in administrative chaos. 37. Countering the submission of the petitioners in the other two petitions, learned Counsel states that the case was squarely covered by Gaurav Singh (supra) and if each candidate is allowed to come with clarifi cations/corrigenda, there will be no end to the selection process and the sanctity of the rule would completely stand negated.
