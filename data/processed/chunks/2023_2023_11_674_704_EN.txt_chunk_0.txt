The scheme of examination specifi cally stipulated that there shall be no cut off marks for the viva voce. Whether the decision of the High Court to prescribe a cut-off for the viva-voce examination was arbitrary. Kerala State Higher Judicial Services Special Rules 1961 – rule 2(c) (iii) – The scheme which was notifi ed by the High Court on 13.12.2012 clearly specifi ed that there would be no cut off marks in respect of the viva-voce – However, the decision of the High Court to prescribe a cut- off for the viva-voce examination was taken much after the viva-voce tests were conducted – Propriety: Held: The Administrative Committee of the High Court decided to impose a cut off for the viva-voce examination actuated by the bona fi de reason of ensuring that candidates with requisite personality assume judicial offi ce – Such a change would be required to be brought in by a substantive amendment to the Rules which came in much later – This is not a case where the rules or the scheme of the High Court were silent – Where the statutory rules are silent, they can be supplemented in a manner consistent 674 SIVANANDAN C T AND OTHERS v. HIGH COURT OF KERALA AND 675 OTHERS with the object and spirit of the Rules by an administrative – In the present case, the statutory rules expressly provided that the select list would be drawn up on the basis of the aggregate of marks obtained in the written examination and the viva-voce – This was further elaborated in the scheme of examination which prescribed that there would be no cut off marks for the viva-voce – This position is also refl ected in the notifi cation of the High Court dated 30.09.2015 – In this backdrop, the decision of the High Court suff ered from its being ultra vires the 1961 Rules besides being manifestly arbitrary. [Paras 15 and 16] Doctrines – Doctrine of legitimate expectation – Claim under: Held: An individual who claims a benefi t or entitlement based on the doctrine of legitimate expectation has to establish: (i) the legitimacy of the expectation; and (ii) that the denial of the legitimate expectation led to the violation of Article 14. [Para 44] Doctrines – Doctrine of legitimate expectation – Whether the High Court’s decision frustrates the legitimate expectation of the petitioners: Held: Rule 2(c)(iii) of the 1961 Rules provided at the material time that 25% of the posts of District and Sessions Judges should be fi lled by direct recruitment from the Bar on the basis of aggregate marks/grade obtained in the written examination and the viva-voce conducted by the High Court – The scheme of examination specifi cally stipulates that there shall be no cut off marks for the viva voce – The petitioners would have expected no minimum cut-off for the viva voce in view of the express stipulation in the scheme of examination – Both the above expectations of the petitioners are legitimate as they are based on the sanction of statutory rules, scheme of examination – The decision of the Administrative Committee to depart from the expected course of preparing the merit list of the selected candidates is contrary to the unamended 1961 Rules – In the instant case, the requirement of a minimum cut-off for the viva-voce was introduced after the viva voce was conducted – The petitioners had no notice that such a requirement would be introduced for the viva voce examination – The High Court’s decision to apply a minimum cut-off for the viva voce frustrated the substantive legitimate expectation of the petitioners – Since, the decision of the High Court is legally untenable and fails on the touchstone of fairness, consistency, and predictability, such a course of action is arbitrary and violative of Article 14.
