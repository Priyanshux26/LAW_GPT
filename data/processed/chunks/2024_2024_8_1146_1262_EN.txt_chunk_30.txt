48 In short ‘CVC’ 49 In short ‘CAG Act’ [2024] 8 S.C.R. 1201 M/s Karnataka Emta Coal Mines Limited and Another v. Central Bureau of Investigation 4.11. That the analysis of the rejects and the manner in which loss was allegedly caused to KPCL, has primarily been arrived at by the respondent – CBI from the Report of the CAG and once this Court has held that the Report of CAG cannot be the basis for launching prosecution against the appellants, the entire basis of launching the prosecution is eroded. 4.12. Stating that contrary to the prescribed procedure that contemplates that the Report of the CAG in relation to the accounts of a Government Company shall be submitted to the Government and the Central Government/State Government, as the case may be, shall place the said Report before each House of the Parliament/State Legislature and the Public Accounts Committee/the Joint Parliamentary Committee is required to scrutinize the said Report. In the instant case, the Report of the CAG has not been accepted either by the Public Accounts Committee or by the Committee of Public Undertakings or by the Joint Parliamentary Committee nor has it been tabled before each House of the Parliament. It is only when the Report is tabled in the Parliament and duly scrutinized and the Government offers its view on the Report, can it form the basis for initiating any action. Decisions in Centre for Public Interest Litigation v. Union of India,50 Arun Kumar Aggarwal v. Union of India51 and Pathan Mohammed Suleman Rehmatkhan v. State of Gujarat52 have been cited to bring home the argument that when the Report of the CAG is subject to scrutiny by the Public Accounts Committee/Joint Parliamentary Committee, it would not be proper to refer to its findings or the conclusions drawn therein. 4.13. That the learned Special Judge, CBI has blindly accepted the charge levelled by the respondent-CBI quantifying the loss purportedly caused to KPCL on account of illegal sale of rejects at ₹49,03,54,159/- (Rupees Forty nine crore three lakh fifty four thousand one hundred and fifty nine only). The observations made in para 104 of the impugned judgement to the effect that 50 [2012] 3 SCR 147 : (2012) 3 SCC 1 51 [2013] 3 SCR 508 : (2013) 7 SCC 1 52 [2013] 12 SCR 446 : (2014) 4 SCC 156 1202 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the respondent-CBI has quantified the rejects on the basis of the documents of KECML and has calculated the loss on the basis of the rate of the lowest grade of coal prevailing at the relevant point of time is therefore, devoid of merits. Reliance has been placed on the information in the Coal Directory of India published by the MoC for the year 2010-2011 that has categorized coal and coke and clarified that w.e.f. January, 2011, by virtue of a notification issued by the MoC, there has been a switchover from the existing Useful Heat Value53 based system of grading and pricing of non-coking coal produced in India to fully variable GCV system.
