This crucial facet has to be determined by considering all circumstances including availability of funds and mere statement or averment in plaint of readiness and willingness, would not suffice.” 9. The Trial Court rightly concluded that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate continuous readiness and willingness to perform their part of the contract. The agreement dated 06.06.1993 explicitly required the plaintiffs to ensure that Defendant Nos. 6 to 8 would come to Baripada within three months to execute the sale deed. The plaintiffs, however, did not take any concrete steps to secure the consent or presence of the sisters within the stipulated period. They relied solely on Defendant No. 1 and late Soumendra to procure the sisters, despite knowing that the sisters were not signatories to the agreement and held a significant share in the property. The Trial Court observed that the plaintiffs did not issue any notices or correspondence to Defendant Nos. 6 to 8 during the three-month period, nor did they make any efforts to communicate with them directly to expedite the execution of the sale deed. This inaction on the part of the plaintiffs indicated a lack of diligence and earnestness in fulfilling their contractual obligations. Furthermore, the plaintiffs continued to operate their petrol pump on the suit land without taking proactive steps to complete the purchase, suggesting complacency and a lack of urgency. 10. The High Court, in contrast, summarily concluded that the plaintiffs were always ready and willing to perform their part of the contract. It stated that there was an abundance of evidence on record to establish the plaintiffs’ financial capacity and willingness. However, the High Court did not delve into the specifics of the plaintiffs’ conduct or address the Trial Court’s findings regarding their inaction. The High Court’s assessment on this crucial aspect was cursory and lacked a thorough examination of the evidence and circumstances that demonstrated the plaintiffs’ lack of readiness and willingness. 11. Upon perusal of the records and submissions, we find merit in the appellants’ contention that the plaintiffs failed to prove their continuous readiness and willingness as required under Section 16(c) of the Specific Relief Act. The terms of the agreement imposed specific obligations on the plaintiffs, particularly in ensuring that Defendant 958 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Nos. 6 to 8 would participate in the execution of the sale deed within three months. The plaintiffs’ failure to take any initiative in this regard is indicative of their lack of commitment to perform the contract. It is pertinent to note that the plaintiffs were aware that Defendant Nos. 6 to 8 were not parties to the agreement and that their consent was crucial for the completion of the sale. Despite this knowledge, the plaintiffs did not attempt to contact the sisters or address any correspondence to them. The plaintiffs also did not furnish any evidence to show that they had arranged the balance consideration amount or were prepared to pay it upon execution of the sale deed. 12.
