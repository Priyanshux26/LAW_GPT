The same must be achieved by leading cogent and satisfactory evidence. 6 (1997) 1 SCC 283 7 Dhananjoy Chatterjee v. State of W.B., (1994) 2 SCC 220; Binay Kumar Singh (supra) Jitender Kumar v.

State of Jharkhand 2022 SCC OnLine SC 109. 818 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. 19.5 It is required to be proved with certainty so as to completely exclude the possibility of the presence of the accused at the spot of the crime. In other words, a standard of ‘strict scrutiny’ is required when such a plea is taken. 20. We notice that the defendants have laid certain evidence attempting to indicate their presence being at a place other than the spot of commission of the off ence. The statements of four witnesses, namely, Sonchand DW-1; Jageshwar Prasad DW-2; Ramadheen DW-3; and Parsu Das DW-4 form part of record. However, DW-3 testifi es to the whereabouts of accused Sandas and DW-4 does so for accused Anand Ram, both of whom the present case does not concern as the appellants before us are Kamal Prasad (A-3), Shersingh (A-6) and Bhavdas (A-9). The two relevant defence witnesses for the convict-appellants before us, are as under:- 20.1 DW-1 states that A-9 is his uncle and had come to his house to go to Sandi Bazar. When the police came to arrest him he mentioned to them that he had just been returning from Bhalesur and did not have any relation with the off ence. He was arrested by the police. 20.2 DW-2 submitted that on the day of the off ence, A-9 went to the shop run by him at Bhalesur to purchase some tea and jaggery. The distance between Bhalesur and Sundri is 16 Kilometres. 21. In our considered view, both these defence witnesses do not conclusively establish the plea of alibi, based on the principle of preponderance of probability as their statements stand unsupported by any other corroborative evidence. Not only that, no reason stands explained in such testimony for A-9 having travelled from Bhalesur to Sundri in to go to Sandi Bazar. It is a matter of record that A-9 is a resident of Bhalesur where he resided with his family. He owned farms in Sundri. The family of A-9 was not examined to substantiate the claim of such travel. For those reasons, we cannot believe the version testifi ed to by DW-1 and DW-2. We also cannot ignore that all 3 primary witnesses of the prosecution i.e., PW-3, PW-16, and PW-17 have categorically deposed the presence of the convict-appellants at the spot of the crime and such a statement could not be shaken in cross-examination.
