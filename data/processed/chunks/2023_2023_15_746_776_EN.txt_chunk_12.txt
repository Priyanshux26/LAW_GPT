v. Rakesh Kohli20 ]. But just as reliance upon equity does not avail an assessee, so it does not avail the Revenue.” 43. The passages extracted above, were quoted with approval by this Court in at least two decisions being CIT v. Kasturi and Sons Ltd.21 and State of W.B. v. Kesoram Industries Ltd.22 (hereinafter referred to as “Kesoram Industries case”, for brevity). In the later decision, a Bench of fi ve Judges, after citing the above passage from Justice G.P. Singh’s treatise, summed up the following principles applicable to the interpretation of a taxing statute: “(i) In interpreting a taxing statute, equitable considerations are entirely out of place. A taxing statute cannot be interpreted on any presumption or assumption. A taxing statute has to be interpreted in the light of what is clearly expressed; it cannot imply anything which is not expressed; it cannot import provisions in the statute so as to supply any defi ciency; (ii) Before taxing any person, it must be shown that he falls within the ambit of the charging section by clear words 16 AIR 1960 SC 1182 17 (1972) 3 SCC 311 : AIR 1972 SC 397 18 (1971) 3 SCC 621 : AIR 1972 SC 2319 19 (1999) 1 SCC 430 : AIR 1999 SC 573 20 (2012) 6 SCC 312 : (2012) 3 SCC (Civ) 481 21 (1999) 3 SCC 346 22 (2004) 10 SCC 201 M/S MODI NATURALS LTD. v. THE COMMISSIONER OF 765 COMMERCIAL TAX UP [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] used in the section; and (iii) If the words are ambiguous and open to two interpretations, the benefi t of interpretation is given to the subject and there is nothing unjust in a taxpayer escaping if the letter of the law fails to catch him on account of the legislature’s failure to express itself clearly.” 44. Applying the aforesaid principles of interpretation, we fi nd it diffi cult to accept the case put up by the revenue as doing so would permit the assessing authority to do something indirectly what he cannot do directly i.e., get around the mandate of the exception carved out by Section 13(3)(b) read with Explanation (iii) by invoking Section 13(1)(f) of the UP VAT Act. 45. It is also pertinent to note that indisputably, the DORB which is produced as part of the Solvent Extraction process is a by-product of the manufacturing process.
