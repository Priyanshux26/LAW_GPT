[Paras 25, 27-29, 33, 35-37, 39] Electricity Act, 2003 – s.2(8) – Electricity Rules, 2005 – r.3(1) (a) – Plea that since s.2(8) uses the expression, “power plant set up by any person”, the captive user u/r.3(1)(a) must be the person who had participated in setting up the plant. It is submitted that, “set up”, does not include the acquisition of shares/ownership after the power plant has already been set up. Therefore, transfer of captive status through transfer of ownership is prohibited under the Act: 346 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. Held: The expression, “set up” used in clause s.2(8) of the Act should not to be read in a pedantic manner as referring to initial set up – The practical reality should be recognised and the impractical asinine consequences of this interpretation should not be ignored – s.2(8) of the Act should not be read as impliedly incorporating a prohibition to transfer of ownership once the CGP has been set up – This bar is not specifi cally stated and mentioned, though the legislature could have stated this in simple words – Rather, in s.9(1) the words used are, “construct, maintain or operate a captive generating plant” – Thus, construction, maintenance or operation of a CGP u/s.9(1) of the Act can be read disjunctively – This emanates from the use of the word, “or”, with reference to “construct, maintain or operate” in s.9(1) – This would be rational and reasonable interpretation in consonance with the legislative intent – It is not necessary that the person who maintains and operates the CGP must have also constructed the CGP – Construction, maintenance or operation can be by diff erent persons – This is brought out in Rule 3 of the Rules which specifi es the eligibility criteria for captive users – r.3 refers to the percentage of ownership of the captive user in the CGP, and use/consumption by the captive user in the fi nancial year. [Para 32] Electricity Act, 2003 – ss.9(2), 9(1) - “every person”; “a person may construct, maintain or operate a captive generating plant”: Held: In s.9(2) the words used are “every person, who has constructed a captive generating plant and maintains and operates such plant” – “every person” can refer to a person who maintains and operates a CGP while not having constructed the CGP, which meaning and interpretation gains affi rmation from the language of s.9(1) which states that a, “a person may construct, maintain or operate a captive generating plant” – In case of ambiguity, it is useful to apply the purpose and object rule of interpretation – A practical interpretation is preferable, so as not to over-ride the legislative intent – It is legitimate for the court to assume that the legislature knows the reality and supports and enacts practicable laws which encourages and promotes business activities – Interpretation of Statutes. [Para 34] Electricity Act, 2003 – Electricity Rules, 2005 – r.3 – Second proviso u/r.3(1)(a); “association of persons” – Interpretation – Proportionality Principle – Unitary qualifying ratio – Explained – Reasoning in Kadodara M/S.
