Supreme Court Reports any tax or fee. Under Section 6A, the right to collect user fees could have been granted to NTBCL through the formulation of Regulations; however, the authority to levy such fees would remain with NOIDA as per Section 19(2)(e) of the 1976 Act. Furthermore, under the said parent Act, NOIDA had no authority to authorise the imposition of fees to another entity. Section 6A was introduced much after the execution of the Concession Agreement and it is not retroactive in nature. (d) The Concession Agreement is perpetual in nature and, therefore, contrary to public policy. Section 2.3 of the Concession Agreement stipulates that the concession period shall extend until the earlier of the two events: the completion of a 30-year period from the effective date or the date on which NTBCL recovers the Total Project Cost and returns, as determined by the Independent Engineer and Independent Auditor in accordance with Article 14 thereof. Furthermore, Section 2.4 states that if the Total Project Cost and returns are not recovered by the end of the 30-year period, the concession period shall, without qualification, be extended for two years at a time until recovery is achieved by NTBCL. According to the report dated 29.08.2007, the Total Project Cost has reached a critical point, rendering it improbable that NTBCL would return the assets to NOIDA, even after a century. (e) Furthermore, under the stipulated formula, the Total Project Cost escalates annually as it comprises of: (a) the Project Cost; (b) major maintenance expenses; and (c) any shortfall in the recovery of returns for a specific financial year. This aggregation directly contributes to the continual increase of the Total Project Cost, rendering it impossible to achieve full returns even after 100 years. This situation necessitates a remedy by balancing the rights of the involved parties. Moreover, if an alternative were pursued and NOIDA were to terminate the Concession Agreement, it would be obligated to compensate NTBCL in excess of Rupees 5000 crores. Given that these clauses impact the contract in its entirety, they must be severed from the rest of the agreement without undermining the overall contract. Consequently, Article 14 of the Concession Agreement, when read in conjunction with the formula, is ex-facie arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. [2024] 12 S.C.R. 2015 Noida Toll Bridge Company Ltd. v. Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Association and Others (f) The Independent Engineer and the Independent Auditor are appointed by a Committee comprising lenders, NTBCL, and NOIDA. Given that the lenders and NTBCL were effectively one and the same, NOIDA was consistently in the minority and lacked the authority to appoint either the Independent Engineer or the Independent Auditor. Consequently, NTBCL retained the power to appoint the personnel responsible for determining the extent of recovery of the Total Project Cost and Returns. This arrangement in a way allowed NTBCL to become a judge in its own cause, which is inherently unfair and unjust, thereby contravening Article 14 of the Constitution. (g) NTBCL was granted 68 acres of land for a negligible annual fee, which was subsequently mortgaged.
