Developments in 2023: It is in the context of IA No. 174896/2019 seeking permission of this Court to construct a Convention Centre at Patnitop that the present issue of reconstitution of CEC is taken up. The said application was allowed by this Court on 24.02.2023 subject to obtaining clearance from the concerned statutory authorities.16 11. The CEC submitted its report on the subject matter on 13.03.2023. When the report was placed before this Court on 24.03.2023, the Court made the following observations regarding the functioning of the CEC. The relevant portion of the dated 24.03.2023 is extracted below:17 “10. In any case, we are of the view that once an is passed by this Court, it is not appropriate for a Committee which was constituted under the very s of this Court to give a report which in effect, questions the correctness or otherwise, of the s passed by this Court. 13 T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of India, [2008] 3 SCR 141 : (2008) 3 SCC 182. 14 T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of India, (2009) 16 SCC 401. 15 T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of India, (2022) 10 SCC 584. 16 IA No. 196062 and 174896 of 2019 in T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of India, W.P. (C) No. 202/1995, dated 24.02.2023 17 IA No. 196062 and 174896 of 2019 along with CEC Report No. 11/2023 in T.N. Godavarman Thirumul- pad v. Union of India, W.P. (C) No. 202/1995, dated 24.03.2023. [2024] 1 S.C.R. 1203 In Re: T. N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of India and Ors. 11. A Committee which is constituted under the s of the Court cannot consider itself to be an appellate authority in regard to the s passed by this Court. 12. We are further informed by the learned Solicitor General that at times, the members of the CEC are not ad idem on all the issues, which are ultimately reported to this Court. 13. We, therefore, direct that hereinafter, wherever there is a separate or dissenting opinion of any of the members of the CEC, such opinion shall also be placed before the Court alongwith the report. 14. It is further informed that some of the members of the Committee have crossed the age of 75 years and some of the members are also living abroad. 15. No doubt, the Committee has rendered yeomen services to the cause of environment. However, we are of the view that for effective functioning of the CEC, it is appropriate that some experts in the relevant fields who are relatively younger to the present incumbents, can contribute in a more energetic and efficient manner. It will therefore be appropriate that some of the old members, who have attained an advanced age or are not available in India all the time, are replaced by younger members.
