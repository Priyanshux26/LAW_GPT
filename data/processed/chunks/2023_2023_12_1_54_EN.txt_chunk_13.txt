1962 SC 1753; Rai Ramkrishna vs. State of Bihar, A.I.R. 1963 SC 1667; Lohia Machines Ltd. vs. Union of India, (1985) 2 SCC 197; State of Himachal Pradesh vs. Yash Pal Garg, (2003) 9 SCC 92; Baharul Islam vs. Indian Medical Association, 2023 SCC OnLine SC 79. ii. That Section 3 (1A) as incorporated by the Amendment and Validation Act of 1997, provides that notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1) of Section 3, when passengers are carried and goods are transported by a motor vehicle and no fare or freight, whether chargeable or not, has been charged or fare or freight has been charged at a concessional rate, the tax at the rates directed by a Notifi cation by the Government under sub-section (1), shall be levied, charged and paid as if the passengers were carried or goods were transported, either on fares or freights fi xed by the competent authority, under the MV Act, for diff erent classes of roads and motor vehicles in the State, or on fares and freights specifi ed in Schedule I to the Act for diff erent classes of roads and motor vehicles, whichever is higher. That previously, under the Act of 1955, Explanation to Section 3(1), which provided that when passengers are carried and goods are transported by a motor vehicle and no fare or freight, whether chargeable or not, had been charged, the tax was levied and paid, as if such passengers were carried or goods transported, at the normal rate prevalent on the 20 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. route. The ambiguity in the charging provision, i.e., Section 3 (1) of the Act of 1955 arose on account of the fact that the terms ‘normal rate’ and ‘route’ had not been defi ned under the said Act. Owing to such a defect/lacuna, the charging provision could not be given eff ect to as noted by the Division Bench of the High Court in the dated 27 March, 1997. That by the Amendment and Validation Act of 1997, Explanation to Section 3(1) has been deleted and Section 3 (1A) has been inserted, prescribing two alternate methods to notionally determine fares or freights, when the same has not been charged, i.e. by taking into account: (a) fares or freights fi xed by the competent authority, under the MV Act, or (b) fares and freights specifi ed in Schedule I to the Act for diff erent classes of roads and motor vehicles: the higher of the two fares is to be adopted in every case. Further, the terms ‘fares’, ‘freights’ and ‘roads’ have been defi ned, thereby removing the defects/defi ciencies in the Act of 1955. iii. That another reason given by the Division Bench in the dated 27 March, 1997 for holding that employees of the appellants and their children were not covered by the Explanation (now deleted by way of the Amendment and Validation Act of 1997) was in relation to the defi nition of ‘business’. ‘The term ‘business’ was defi ned in a narrow manner in the Act of 1955 and meant the business of carriage of passengers and goods.
