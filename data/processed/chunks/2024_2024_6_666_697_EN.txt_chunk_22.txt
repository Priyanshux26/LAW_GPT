51. As a result, the appellant is entitled to a direction for release from custody by applying the ratio of the rendered by this Court in the case of Pankaj Bansal (supra). 52. Accordingly, the arrest of the appellant followed by remand dated 4th October, 2023 and so also the impugned passed by the High Court of Delhi dated 13th October, 2023 are hereby declared to be invalid in the eyes of law and are quashed and set aside. 53.
