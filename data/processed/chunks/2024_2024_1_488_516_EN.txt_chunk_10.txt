Before we interpret sub-clause (d) of Clause 29A, it is necessary to refer to the provisions of the Sales Tax Act. In the said Act, the definition of “sale” required the transfer of property in goods by any person by cash, deferred payment, or other valuable consideration. The VAT Act came into force with effect from 28th April 2005. The VAT Act repealed the Sales Tax Act. The VAT Act is in conformity with the 46th Amendment to the Constitution of India, particularly Clause 29A of Article 366. The definition of “sale” in sub-section (43) of Section 2 of the VAT Act is very exhaustive which is in terms of Clause 29A of Article 366 of the Constitution of India. Clause (iv) of sub-section (43) of Section 2 of the VAT Act contains an inclusive definition of “sale”, which includes, “a transfer of the right to use any goods for any purpose (whether or not for a specified period) for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration”. 22. In the present group of appeals, broadly, we are dealing with the following categories of cases: a. Agreements for hiring cranes; b. Agreements for hiring trucks; 502 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports c. Agreements for hiring of buses; d. Agreements for transportation of petroleum products by vehicles; e. Agreements for hiring trailers; f. Agreements for hiring water tankers; and g. Agreements for hiring of scrapping winch chassis. 23. The impugned and subject matter of challenge in Civil Appeal no.3548 of 2017 decides a group of 20 cases wherein the agreements were for providing/hiring cranes to ONGC and agreements pertaining to water tankers and trailers. The said was against the assessee. 24. Civil Appeal no.383 of 2013 arises from the contract between the transport agencies and the appellant–IOCL, for transporting petroleum products by vehicles. The impugned and is of 24th July 2012. Civil Appeal No. 3548 of 2017 has been preferred by the assessee. The same is the case with Civil Appeal No. 383 of 2013. Civil Appeal No. 3580 of 2017 has been preferred by the Union of India. Civil Appeal no.4657 of 2013 is preferred by the assessee for challenging the and dated 24th July 2012. By the said , again, a group of cases were decided by the Gauhati High Court. Even the said cases were decided against the assessee on the basis of the decision, which is the subject matter of challenge in Civil Appeal No. 3548 of 2017. 25. Civil Appeal no.3580 of 2017 is in the nature of a cross-appeal preferred by the Union of India against the , which is the subject matter of challenge in Civil Appeal 4657 of 2013. This was a case of a contract for the supply of trailers. In this case, the contention raised by the Union of India is that the transaction does not amount to a sale within the meaning of the VAT Act and that the agreement is of rendering service. 26. The entire controversy revolves around the question of whether the transactions reflected from the agreements subject matter of these appeals amount to a sale within the meaning of sub-clause (d) of Clause 29A of Article 366 of the Constitution of India and, consequently, whether it is a “sale” within the meaning of clause (iv) of sub-section (43) of Section 2 of the VAT Act.
