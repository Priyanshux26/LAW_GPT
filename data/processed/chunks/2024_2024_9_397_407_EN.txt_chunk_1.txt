The appellant claims that he has been practising as a general Physician since 2001 and as a Radiologist since 2007. On 27th April 2017, a team comprising four officers raided the appellant’s clinic. Based on the complaint against one woman, Dhanpati (accused no.1), that she is running a racket of sex determination and medical termination of pregnancy, a decoy patient was selected. The allegation is that Dhanpati was contracted to do the medical termination of the pregnancy of the decoy patient. The decoy patient and shadow witness, S.I. Usha Rani, informed Dhanpati that they knew the sex of the foetus. Dhanpati called the decoy patient on 27th April 2017 at 8 am for MTP. The shadow witness informed Dhanpati that family members of the decoy patient were suggesting reconfirming the sex of the foetus through ultrasound. Dhanpati called the shadow witness on 27th April 2017 at 7 am and stated that the Doctor who would perform the ultrasound would charge Rs.20,000/- but ultimately, she fixed the deal at Rs.15,000/-. 400 [2024] 9 S.C.R.

The members of the search party, along with the police staff as well as the shadow witness and decoy patient, went to the Gurugram bus stand where Dhanpati asked for Rs.15,000/- which amount was handed over to her. After that, a nurse, Anju (accused no.2), was called by Dhanpati, and a part of the amount of Rs.15,000/- was given to her. Thereafter, the decoy patient and others entered the appellant’s clinic, known as the Divine Diagnostic Centre at Gurugram. The decoy patient was taken inside. When the decoy patient and Anju came out of the diagnostic centre, the police caught them. The search team entered the diagnostic centre. The cash amount was seized, and the team recovered even the USG report for the decoy patient.
