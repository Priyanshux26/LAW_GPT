In support of his submissions, he has relied upon the decisions of this Court in the case of Mathew Varghese v. M. Amritha Kumar, (2014) 5 SCC 610 (para 38); Narandas Karsondas vs. S.A. Kamtam, (1977) 3 SCC 247; B. Arvind Kumar vs. Govt. of India & Ors., (2007) 5 SCC 745 (para 12). He has also relied upon the decision of the Punjab and Haryana E High Court in the case of Pal Alloys & Metal India Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. vs. Allahabad Bank & Ors., 2021 SCC OnLine P&H 2733 as well as the decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case of M/s India Finlease Securities Ltd. vs. Prasad Indian Overseas Bank, 2012 SCC OnLine AP 205. F 5.3 It is further submitted by learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent no.1 that the respondent no.1 has subsequently died and his heirs including the widow are residing in the flat in question since long and that they have paid/deposited the entire sale consideration and therefore if now the appeal is allowed in that case, they have to vacate G the premises which will not be equitable. Therefore, it is prayed to dismiss the present appeal. 6. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Bank has though opposed the writ petition before the High Court, has stated that whatever the decision, the Bank shall abide by the same. H G. VIKRAM KUMAR v. STATE BANK OF HYDERABAD & 635 ORS. [M. R. SHAH, J.] 7. Heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective A parties at length. 8. At the outset, it is required to be noted that what was challenged before the High Court by respondent no.1 in a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India was the e-auction notice which was pursuant to the action initiated by the Bank in exercise of powers under B Section 13(4) of the SARFAESI Act. At this stage it is required to be noted that e-auction was held/conducted on 31.08.2016 in which the appellant participated and was declared as a successful bidder and he made a payment of 25% of the bid amount on the very day i.e., on 31.08.2016. However, thereafter the respondent no.1 filed the writ petition C before the High Court challenging the e-auction notice dated 28.07.2016 on 14.09.2016 that is after conducting of the auction. It is required to be noted that against any steps taken by the Bank under Section 13(4) of the SARFAESI Act the aggrieved party has a remedy under the SARFAESI Act by way of appeal under Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act to approach the DRT. Therefore, in view of the availability of the D alternative statutory remedy available by way of proceedings/appeal under Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act, the High Court ought not to have entertained the writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India in which the e-auction notice was under challenge. Therefore, the High Court has committed a very serious error in entertaining the E writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India challenging the e-auction notice issued by the Bank in exercise of power under Section 13(4) of the SARFAESI Act.
