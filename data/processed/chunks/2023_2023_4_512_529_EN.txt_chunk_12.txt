to the High Court on a monthly basis while maintaining an independent A record thereof. 41.It cannot be doubted that had there been properly preserved records of the Trial Court, the issue in the present appeal as to whether the High Court could uphold a conviction having not perused the complete Trial Court record, would not have arisen. Judicial notice can be taken of B the fact that, in accordance with the SOP issued, private entities providing specialized service have been contracted, and therefore considering the importance and essentiality of such record, a robust system of responsibility and accountability must be developed and fostered in to ensure the proper protection and regular updation of all records C facilitating the smooth functioning of the judicial process. 42.Therefore, this Court finds it fit to issue the following directions: 1. The Registrar General of the High Courts shall ensure that in all cases of criminal trial, as well as civil suits, the digitization of records must be duly undertaken with promptitude at all District D Courts, preferably within the time prescribed for filing an appeal within the laws of procedure. 2. The concerned District Judge, once the system of digitization along with the system of authentication of the digitized records is in place in their judgeship, to ensure that the records so digitized E are verified as expeditiously as possible. 3. A continually updated record of Register of Records digitized shall be maintained with periodic reports being sent to the concerned High Courts for suitable directions. 4. Interlocutory application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. F Nidhi Jain Appeal allowed. (Assisted by : Rakhi, LCRA) G H
