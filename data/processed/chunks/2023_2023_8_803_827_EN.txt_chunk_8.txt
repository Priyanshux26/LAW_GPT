Chidambranar Port Trust Tuticorin 2021 SCC Online SC 508. 2 Union of India and Others v. Master Construction Company (2011) 12 SCC 349. H 814 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A contractor after furnishing the No Claim Certificate. It was in the context of the said facts that this Court after an exhaustive review of earlier case law which we must notice included the of this Court reported in National Insurance Company Limited v. Boghara Polyfab Private Limited (2009) 1 SCC 267 went on to hold as follows: B “23. The present, in our opinion, appears to be a case falling in the category of exception noted in Boghara Polyfab (P) Ltd. [(2009) 1 SCC 267 : (2009) 1 SCC (Civ) 177] (p. 284, para 25). As to financial duress or coercion, nothing of this kind is established prima facie. Mere allegation that no-claim certificates have been obtained under financial duress and coercion, without there being C anything more to suggest that, does not lead to an arbitrable dispute. The conduct of the contractor clearly shows that “no-claim certificates” were given by it voluntarily; the contractor accepted the amount voluntarily and the contract was discharged voluntarily.” 13. In National Insurance Company Limited3 this Court inter D alia held as follows: “The questions for consideration 15. In this case existence of an arbitration clause in the contract of insurance is not in dispute. It provides that “if any dispute or difference shall arise as to the quantum to be paid under this policy E (liability being otherwise admitted) such difference shall, independently to all other questions be referred to the decision of a sole arbitrator”. The rival contentions give rise to the following question for our consideration: In what circumstances, a court will refuse to refer a dispute F relating to quantum to arbitration, when the contract specifically provides for reference of disputes and differences relating to the quantum to arbitration? In particular, what is the position when a respondent in an application under Section 11 of the Act, resists reference to arbitration on the ground that the petitioner has issued G a full and final settlement discharge voucher and the petitioner contends that he was constrained to issue it due to coercion, undue influence and economic compulsion? 17. The decision in Kishorilal Gupta [AIR 1959 SC 1362 : (1960) 1 SCR 493] was followed and reiterated in several decisions H including Naihati Jute Mills Ltd. v. Khyaliram Jagannath [AIR UNION OF INDIA & ORS. v. M/S. BHARAT ENTERPRISE 815 [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] 1968 SC 522] , Damodar Valley Corpn. v. K.K. Kar [(1974) 1 A SCC 141] and Indian Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. Indo Swiss Synthetics Gem Mfg. Co. Ltd. [(1996) 1 SCC 54] In Damodar Valley Corpn. [(1974) 1 SCC 141] this Court observed : (SCC p. 145, para 7) “7. … A contract is the creature of an agreement between the B parties and where the parties under the terms of the contract agree to incorporate an arbitration clause, that clause stands apart from the rights and obligations under that contract, as it has been incorporated with the object of providing a machinery for the settlement of disputes arising in relation to or in connection with C that contract.
