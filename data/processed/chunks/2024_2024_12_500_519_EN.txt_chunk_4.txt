Rejecting the contention of the respondent plaintiffs based on Section 14(2) and also rejecting the applicability of the of this Court in Karmi v. Amru3 and certain other decisions of the same High Court, the Trial Court dismissed the suit. Even in the first appeal, the respondent-plaintiffs relied on Karmi (supra) and certain other decisions of this Court to submit that the disposition of the property by the wife of the testator falls under sub-section (2) of Section 14. The First Appellate Court dismissed the appeal and affirmed the decision of the Trial Court following the principle in Tulsamma and also rejected the submission of the respondent based on Karmi’s decision. The High Court, from which the impugned arises reversed the concurrent findings of the court below only on a question of law.

Bakthavatsalam.10 On the other hand, Mr. Sunil K. Mittal, learned counsel for the respondents has submitted that the decision of Karmi (supra) is of a three-Judge bench and it has not been overruled. He would further submit that the said was in fact followed in Bhura and Ors. v. Kashiram11 where the position of law involving interplay between sub-section 1 and 2 of Section 14 has been explained. He would also rely on the decision in Sadhu Singh (supra) which was also relied on by the High Court. Further, it was submitted that s in Gaddam Ramakrishnareddy and Ors. v.
