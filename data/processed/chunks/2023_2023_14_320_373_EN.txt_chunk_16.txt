F. Joint Hindu family and coparcenary under Mitakshara 21. Traditionally, a Joint Hindu family comprises of male members who are lineal descendants from a common male ancestor, together with their mothers, wives or widows and unmarried daughters. A Joint Hindu family has been described as ‘a larger body’ consisting of a group of persons united by sapindaship or family relationship34. 22. A Hindu coparcenary comprises of a propositus and three lineal descendants. A Hindu coparcenary is a body which is narrower than a Hindu Undivided Family. Before 2005, it included only sons, grandsons and great- grandsons who were holders of joint property.35 (Vineeta Sharma v. Rakesh Sharma36 (“Vineeta Sharma”). 23. In State Bank of India v. Ghamandi Ram37 (“Ghamandi Ram”), this Court observed that under the Mitakshara school of Hindu law, all the 32 Submitted by Mr. Samrat K Shinde, Advocate on Record on behalf of the Respondents in Hanumant Namdeo Jadhav & Ors v Kashibai Namdeo Jadhav & Ors, SLP (C) No. 27834 of 2017 33 (2020) 13 SCC 585 34 Sunil Kumar v.

Before 2005, it included only those persons like sons, grandsons and great-grandsons who are the holders of joint property. For example, in case A is holding the property, B is his son, C is his grandson, D is great-grandson, and E is a great-great-grandson. The coparcenary will be formed up to D i.e. great-grandsons, and only on the death of A, holder of the property, the right of E would ripen in coparcenary as coparcenary is confi ned to three lineal descendants. Since grandsons and great-grandsons become coparceners by birth, they acquired an interest in the property.” 36 (2020) 9 SCC 1 37 (1969) 2 SCC 33 344 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. property of a Hindu Joint Family is held in collective ownership by all the coparceners in a “quasi-corporate capacity”. The Court held that the incidents of a coparcenary are that: (i) The lineal male descendants of a person up to a third generation acquire on birth ownership in the ancestral properties of such person; (ii) Such descendants can at any time work out their rights by seeking partition; (iii) Until partition, the ownership of every member of the coparcenary extends over the entire property conjointly with the rest; (iv) The consequence of such co-ownership is that possession and enjoyment of the properties is common; (v) No alienation of the property is possible unless it is for a necessity, without the concurrence of the coparceners; and (vi) The deceased member’s interest in a coparcenary lapses on his death in favor of his survivors. 24. The hallmark of a coparcenary is that a lineal male descendent up to the third generation would acquire an independent right of ownership by birth and the interest of a deceased member would lapse on his death and merge in the coparcenary property.
