10. The State Government, thereafter, issued a notice under Section 10(5) of the Ceiling Act on 4th March, 1980 asking the appellants to deliver possession of the ‘vacant land’. 11. The appellants challenged the action of the State declaring the land ‘vacant’ before the High Court in a writ petition wherein the parties were directed to maintain the status quo on 15th April, 1980. The writ petition was dismissed by a learned Single Judge on 25th June, 1987. The appellants then fi led an intra-court appeal in which ad interim was allowed to continue. The said appeal was fi nally dismissed on 19th May, 2011. The appellants then approached this Court and on 21st November, 2011 the parties were directed to maintain the status quo and not to create 3rd party rights or change the nature and character of the property. 12. The precise contention raised before the High Court and reiterated before us on behalf of the appellants is that the procedure of calculating ‘excess vacant land’ adopted by the Competent Authority is derogatory to Section 2(q)(i) and 2(q)(ii) read with Clause 20(2) of Building Regulations notifi ed under the Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act, 1951. 13. It is broadly an admitted fact that the appellants in their statement under Section 6(1) of the Ceiling Act declared the entire piece of land measuring 3429 sq.m. as ‘vacant land’. They, however, in their objection against the draft statement claimed existence of a structure, the area of which was liable to be excluded from ‘vacant land’ in view of Section 2(q)(ii) of M/S. KEWAL COURT PVT. LTD. AND ANR. v. THE STATE 731 OF WEST BENGAL AND ORS. [SURYA KANT, J.] the Ceiling Act. Such an objection did not fi nd favour with the Competent Authority, which after excluding retainable area measuring 500 sq.m. as per Section 4(1)(a), declared the remaining land measuring 2929 sq.m. as ‘vacant land’. 14. As of now, we need not consider the question whether there existed any `building’ within the meaning of sub-clause (ii) of Section 2(q) of the Ceiling Act on the subject land which could qualify for exclusion from the permeates of a ‘vacant land’. This is largely a question of fact and will be determined at the time of fi nal hearing. 15. The arguments of Shri Jaideep Gupta, learned Senior Counsel for the appellants are predominantly restricted to the interpretation and scope of sub-clause (i) of Section 2(q) of the Ceiling Act. His precise case is that as per the statutory Building Regulations in force, construction of a building is permissible only up to 50% area of the subject land and the remaining 50% is required to be kept open. The half of the land, which is unconstructable, is liable to be excluded from the total area of ‘vacant land’. In this manner, land measuring 1714.50 sq.m. will stand excluded under Section 2(q)(i). Out of the remaining ‘vacant land’ measuring 1714.50 sq.m., the appellants are entitled to retain 500 sq.m. as per the ceiling limit [see Section 4(1)(a)] and in this manner the ‘excess vacant land’ that can be acquired from them comes to 1214.50 sq.m.
