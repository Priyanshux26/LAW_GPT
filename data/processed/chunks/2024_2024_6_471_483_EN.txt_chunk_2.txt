Rule 6 of the 2001 Rules provides for a preference in favour of candidates between the age bracket of 29 and 40 years. In other words, amongst the eligible candidates belonging to a scheduled tribe, those who fall within the age bracket of 29- 40 years, would have a preferential right to be appointed over and above even meritorious candidates. 4. The appellant and respondent No. 7 are both ST candidates, and both of them were eligible for appointment to the solitary post of Assistant Professor in the English department reserved for a candidate beloniging to the ST community. While the appellant was higher in merit, respondent no. 7 was within the age bracket of 29-40 years, and as such, was a preferential candidate as per Rule 6 of the 2001 Rules. Though the university advertised that the ‘Mode of Selection’ shall be as per the 2001 Rules, it followed its own procedure and proceeded to appoint the appellant on the basis of merit. Respondent no. 7 naturally challenged the appointment of the appellant by filing Writ Petition No. 4923/2020 before the High Court of Karnataka. 5. The Ld. Single Judge of the High Court, by a dated 16.01.2021, allowed the writ petition and set aside the appellant’s 2 “MODE OF SELECTION The list of selected candidates will be prepared as per the following Government of Karnataka Notifications: 1. No. DPAR 13 SBC 2001 dated: 21.11.2001 & Dated: 01.06.2002 2. UGC Regulations 2010, UGC (4th Amendment) Regulations, 2016 and AICTE 2016 Regulations.” [2024] 6 S.C.R. 475 Chaitra Nagammanavar v. State of Karnataka & Ors. selection and appointment on the ground that the university specifically declared in the advertisement that the ‘Mode of Selection’ shall be as per the 2001 Rules. Therefore, its appointment of the appellant, who did not fall in the age bracket of 29-40 years, was illegal. Consequently, Respondent No. 7, who is the preferential candidate, was directed to be appointed. 6. The appellant and the university filed their respective writ appeals, namely W.A. 190/2021 and 233/2021, before the Division Bench of the High Court. While confirming the of the Single Judge, the Division Bench also directed that respondent No. 7 is entitled to be appointed as per the 2001 Rules. Thus, the present Civil Appeal by the appellant, who was the originally appointed candidate. 7. Before we consider the rival contentions, it is necessary to refer to three legislations that have a bearing on the case. The Karnataka State Civil Services Act, 19783; the Karnataka SCs, STs and OBCs (Reservation of Appointments etc.) Act, 19904; and the Karnataka State Universities Act, 20005. Very importantly, we will also consider the applicability of the 2001 Rules framed under the Civil Services Act, 1978. 8. The relevant law governing the filling up of backlog vacancies as per the advertisement issued by the university will be the Reservation Act, 1990 and the 2001 Rules. These rules are made under the Civil Services Act, which naturally relates to civil services under the State of Karnataka.
