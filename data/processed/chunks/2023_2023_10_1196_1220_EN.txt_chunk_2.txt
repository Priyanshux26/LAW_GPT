Thus, the contention that a summoned person must be given an opportunity of being heard before being added as an accused to face the trial E is clearly not contemplated under Section 319 Cr.P.C. It is also observed by this Court in Hardeep Singh that such a summoned person can assail a summoning before a superior Court and will also have the right of cross examining the witnesses as well as can let in his defence evidence, if any. [Para 32] [1219-D-H; 1220-A-B] F 4. The lateral entry of a person summoned in exercise of power under Section 319 Cr.P.C. is only to face the trial along with other accused. This, being a salutary provision in to meet the ends of justice, the same cannot be diluted by importing within the scope of Section 319 Cr.P.C. principles of natural justice G which in any case would be followed during the trial. It is well settled that principles of natural justice cannot be applied in strait- jacket formula and they would depend upon the facts of each case and the object and purpose to be achieved under a provision of law. [Para 33][1220-B-C] H YASHODHAN SINGH & ORS. v. THE STATE OF UTTAR 1199 PRADESH & ANR. 5. The in Jogendra Yadav does not call for any A re-consideration and the said observation in paragraph 9 is relatable only to the facts of the said case. Thus, the principle of hearing a person who is summoned cannot be read into Section 319 Cr.P.C. Such a procedure is not at all contemplated therein. In the circumstances, this Court does not accept the contentions B of the appellants herein. [Para 34][1220-D-E] Sukhpal Singh Khair v. State of Punjab (2023) 1 SCC 289; Brijendra Singh & Ors. v/s.
