Collector’s – As soon as they learnt of such decree in Dfdt. No.1’s favour against the Gram Panchayat, they fi led Suit– High Court rightly held that the suit was fi led within time – Bhondedar could not have transferred his limited possessory rights or alienated the said property to the Appellants who in turn, as transferees, could not have derived any legal right over the suit land either – High Court’s decision in favour of the plaintiff s and the Gram Panchayat consistent with the opinion of this Court. [Paras10, 14, 17, 20, 23, 24] Land Laws – Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Act, 1961 – Inter-play of claims over shamlatdeh category land vis-à-vis the bhondedar, the Gram Panchayat and the proprietors of such land: Held: The ownership to such lands rested in proportion to other lands of the village – For instance, an individual owning some land in the village also possessed additional proprietary rights and interest over shamlatdeh lands – However, with the enactment of the 1961 Act, the nature of vesting of such lands with the village community was somewhat altered – While such LAJJA RAM & ORS. v. RATI CHAND & ORS. ETC 1527 lands owned by the proprietors came to be vested in the Gram Panchayat, the s.4 of the 1961 Act noted certain important exceptions – The existing rights, title or interest of persons, who though not entered as occupancy tenants in the revenue records are accorded a similar status by custom like a bhondedar, dholidar, etc. and those would not be aff ected by such vesting of lands in the Gram Panchayat. [Paras 15, 16] Words and Phrases – ‘Bhondedar’ – Characteristic features: Held: A ‘bhondedar’ renders secular services towards the village community as well as the biswedars (proprietors) – He is granted a parcel of land rent-free, within a village by the biswedars in lieu of payment for services rendered, and a bhondedar can be ejected from such piece of land on failure to render assigned services or fulfi l conditions of such grant.
