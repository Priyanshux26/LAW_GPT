[(2004) 3 SCC 1] 14. Suppression of a material document would also amount to a fraud on the court. (See Gowrishankar v. Joshi Amba Shankar Family Trust [(1996) 3 SCC 310] and S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu case [(1994) 1 SCC 1].) 15. “Fraud” is a conduct either by letter or words, which induces the other person or authority to take a definite determinative stand as a response to the conduct of the former either by words or letter. Although negligence is not fraud but it can be evidence on fraud; as observed in Ram Preeti Yadav case [(2003) 8 SCC 311]. 16. In Lazarus Estates Ltd. v. Beasley [(1956) 1 QB 702: (1956) 1 All ER 341: (1956) 2 WLR 502 (CA)] Lord Denning observed at QB pp. 712 and 713 : (All ER p. 345 C) 1010 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports “No of a court, no of a minister, can be allowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud. Fraud unravels everything.” In the same Lord Parker, L.J. observed that fraud vitiates all transactions known to the law of however high a degree of solemnity. (p. 722) These aspects were recently highlighted in State of A.P. v. T. Suryachandra Rao [(2005) 6 SCC 149: (2005) 5 SCALE 621].’ 15. An interesting passage on fraud can be found in Reddaway (Frank) & Co. Ltd. v George Banham & Co. Ltd., 1896 AC 199, where the House of Lords stated: ‘But fraud is infinite in variety; sometimes it is audacious and unblushing; sometimes it pays a sort of homage to virtue, and then it is modest and retiring; it would be honesty itself if it could only afford it. But fraud is fraud all the same; and it is the fraud, not the manner of it, which calls for the interposition of the Court.’7 16. From the record, we do not find that the Insurance Company has discharged its onus to prove the alleged fraud. Therefore, the Insurance Company’s liability under the issued insurance certificate/ policy to cover the incident, cannot be escaped by alleging fraud. 17. Thus, on an overall circumspection, the Court does not find any merit in the present appeals, which, accordingly, stand dismissed. No as to cost. 18. The Insurance Company shall deposit the monies as per the Award passed by the MACT, if not already done, latest by 15.01.2025. The same shall be distributed forthwith to the claimants by the MACT. Result of the case: Appeals dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Harshit Anand, Hony.
