46. In State of WB v. Committee for Protection of Democratic Rights,80 a Constitution Bench held that the principle of federal supremacy in Article 246 can be resorted to only when there is an ‘irreconcilable direct conflict’ between the entries in List I and List II.81 ii. Scheme of legislative entries 47. The lists in the Seventh Schedule demarcate the legislative fields between Parliament and the State Legislatures. They do not confer power but stipulate broad fields of legislation.82 The source 76 [1983] 3 SCR 130 : (1983) 4 SCC 45 77 Also see In re Central Provinces and Berar Act 14 of 1938, AIR 1939 FC 1 78 (1983) 4 SCC 45 [38] 79 AIR 1939 FC 1 [41] 80 [2010] 2 SCR 979 : (2010) 3 SCC 571 81 (2010) 3 SCC 571 [27]; Also see In re C.P & Berar Taxation Act, AIR 1939 FC 1 82 See Calcutta Gas Co.

[2024] 10 S.C.R. 1989 State of U.P. & Ors. v. M/s Lalta Prasad Vaish and sons of the power of Parliament and State Legislatures emanates from Articles 245 and 246 of the Constitution. These provisions in the Constitution have been borrowed from Sections 99 and 100 of the Government of India Act 193583 with necessary modifications. The demarcation of legislative fields is based on a deliberate design as well as on the principles of federalism. Matters requiring coordination between different regions of the country or of national importance have been placed in the field of Parliament. Matters requiring localized focus and limited or no coordination between States have been placed in the State List. Fields of legislation which may require either uniform legislation for the entire nation or context and region-specific accommodation, depending on the circumstance, are placed in the Concurrent List. Moreover, the three lists make a clear distinction between general entries and taxation entries. The power of taxation cannot be derived from a general entry.84 The entries in the legislative lists do not cast an obligation to legislate or to legislate in a particular manner. Within the confines of an entry, the legislature exercises plenary power subject to the provisions of the Constitution.85 48. Numerous language devices are used in the Seventh Schedule to prevent the conflict of entries and ensure a clear demarcation of the fields of entry. The entries in List II use the following language devices: a. ‘Subject to’ a specific provision of List I or List III: Entries 2,17,22, 24,26,27,33 and 57; b. ‘Subject to’ provisions of an entire list with regard to the subject matter: Entry 13; c. ‘Not specified in’ or ‘other than those specified in’ List I: Entries 13, 32 and 63; and d. ‘Subject to’ law made by Parliament or ‘subject to’ any limitations imposed by Parliament by law: Entries 37 and 50. 83 “1935 Act” 84 State of Karnataka v.
