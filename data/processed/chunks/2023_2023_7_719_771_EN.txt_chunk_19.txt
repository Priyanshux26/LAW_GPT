OF DELHI 745 [MANOJ MISRA, J.] cloth) at about 4.00 p.m. on 11.09.2000, whereas PW4, during A investigation, stated that he saw the deceased playing cards and having liquor with the two accused at or about 9.00 p.m. on 11.09.2000. However, during their deposition in court neither PW3 nor PW4 disclosed about the presence of Santosh @ Bhure in or around that apartment/building at any time on 11.09.2000 or after, till recovery of dead body of the B deceased. Therefore, they were declared hostile. During cross examination, at the instance of the prosecution, PW3 denied having seen Santosh @ Bhure exiting the building with a Gathri on 11.09.2000. Not only that, PW3 resiled from his previous statement, made during investigation, that, at or about noon of 11.09.2000, Santosh @ Bhure had come to his grocery shop to purchase snacks etc. Thus, from the statement C of PW3, it is not at all established that the appellant Santosh @ Bhure was present in the house on 11.09.2000 or any time thereafter till recovery of the body of the deceased. 34. Rather, from the deposition of PW3 an important circumstance emerges, which is, that the apartment from where the body was retrieved D on 12.09.2000 was not found locked or shut. PW3’s deposition is that on 12.09.2000 while he was at his grocery shop, located on the ground floor of that building, a washer woman informed him that blood was lying on the second floor of the building. On getting this information, he went upstairs to notice that a person is lying dead on a folding cot with blood E on the floor. There is no statement of PW3 or of any other witness that door of that apartment was shut or locked and had to be broke open. This assumes importance in the context of PW4’s deposition. 35. PW4 is a tenant of the first floor of that building. As per his testimony, on 11.09.2000, between noon and 1.00 p.m., when he visited F the apartment of Santosh @ Bhure he found Hari Shankar (the deceased) present there in a drunken condition. PW4 does not state that Santosh was also present there. Rather, according to PW4, when he enquired from Hari Shankar the whereabouts of Santosh, he was informed that Santosh is not there. No doubt, PW4 was declared hostile and cross examined but, during cross examination, he denied making a statement G that in the night of 11.09.2000, at about 9.00 p.m., he had noticed Hari Shankar playing cards with Neeraj and Santosh in that apartment. What emerges from PW4’s testimony is that Hari Shankar was noticed alone in that apartment on 11.09.2000 between noon and 1.00 p.m. In short, the prosecution has failed to demonstrate (a) that the apartment was H 746 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A locked or in exclusive control of Santosh @ Bhure and (b) that the deceased was in the company of Santosh or Neeraj on 11.09.2000 or any time thereafter, till recovery of the body of the deceased.
