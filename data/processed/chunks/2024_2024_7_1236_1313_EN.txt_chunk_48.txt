This finding is consistent with our legislative regime of protecting the rights of married women against matrimonial harassment, vide Juveria Abdul Majid Patni vs. Atif Iqbal Mansoori (2014) 10 SCC 736. Access to Justice: 38. The question of interpreting Section 3 of the 1986 Act should also be construed from the perspective of access to justice. Therefore, a technical or pedantic interpretation of the 1986 Act would stultify not merely gender justice but also the constitutional right of access to justice for the aggrieved Muslim divorced women who are in dire need of maintenance. This Court would not countenance unjust or Faustian bargains being imposed on women. The emphasis is on sufficient maintenance, not minimal amount. After all, maintenance is a facet of gender parity and enabler of equality, not charity. It follows that a destitute Muslim woman has the right to seek maintenance under Section 125 of the CrPC despite the enactment of the 1986 Act. Thus, an application for maintenance under Section 125 of the CrPC would not prejudice another application under Section 3 of the 1986 Act insofar as the latter is additional in nature and does not pertain to the same requirements sought to be provided for by Section 125 of the CrPC. One cannot be a substitute for or supplant another; rather it is in addition to and not in derogation of the other. 39. In this context, it would be apposite to take note of this Court’s pertinent observations in Rana Nahid @ Reshma @ Sana vs. Sahidul Haq Chisti (2020) 7 SCC 657. The appeal before this Court arose out of a passed by the High Court of Rajasthan, by which the passed by the Family Court, converting the application for maintenance under Section 125 of the CrPC into Section 3 of the [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1303 Mohd. Abdul Samad v. The State of Telangana & Anr. 1986 Act and granting maintenance, was set aside. Banumathi, J. in her considered the question which fell for consideration, namely, whether the Family Court had jurisdiction to try an application filed by a Muslim divorced woman for maintenance under Section 3 of the Act. After considering the provisions of the 1986 Act as well as the relevant provisions of the Family Courts Act, 1984, it was observed in paragraph 25 of the that an application under Section 3(2) of the 1986 Act by the divorced wife has to be filed before the competent Magistrate having jurisdiction if she claims maintenance beyond the iddat period. Even if the Family Court has been established in that area, the Family Court, not having been conferred the jurisdiction under Section 7 of the Family Courts Act, 1984 to entertain an application filed under Section 3 of the 1986 Act, the Family Court shall have no jurisdiction to entertain an application under Section 3(2) of the 1986 Act. The Family Court, therefore, cannot convert the petition for maintenance under Section 125 of the CrPC to one under Section 3 or Section 4 of the 1986 Act.
