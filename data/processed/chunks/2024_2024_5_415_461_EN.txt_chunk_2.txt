(Concurring) A citizen’s right ‘to freedom of speech and expression’ u/Article 19(1) is not absolute and the State by virtue of Article 19(2) can place reasonable restrictions on these rights – The ordainment of r. 49M (3) is that the VVPAT slip should be momentarily visible to the voter; and it is not the requirement of the rule that the VVPAT slip or its copy has to be handed over to the voter – Recording of the vote cast signifying the choice of the voter and its projection on the VVPAT slip, albeit for 7 seconds, is fulfilment of the voter’s right of being informed that his/her vote has been duly recorded – As long as there is no allegation of statutory breach, there can be no substitution of the Court’s view for the view of the ECI that the light in the VVPAT would be on for 7 seconds and not more – There is in place a stringent system of checks and balances (Form 17A, 17C, r.56D(4), 56-D), to prevent any possibility of a miscount of votes, and for the voter to know that his/her vote has [2024] 5 S.C.R. 419 Association For Democratic Reforms v. Election Commission of India And Another been counted – Such a system, which is distinctly more satisfactory compared to the system of the yester-years, suitably satisfies the voter’s right under Article 19(1)(a) to know that his/her vote has been counted as recorded. [Paras 69, 73, 16, 17] Directions by Supreme Court – 2024 General Elections underway for constituting the 18th Lok Sabha – Directions issued to further strengthen the integrity of election process: Held: On completion of the symbol loading process in the VVPATs undertaken on or after 01.05.2024, the symbol loading units be sealed and secured, as directed and be opened, examined and dealt with as in the case of EVMs; the burnt memory/microcontroller in 5% of the EVMs, that is, the control unit, ballot unit and the VVPAT, per assembly constituency/assembly segment of a parliamentary constituency be checked and verified by the team of engineers from the manufacturers of the EVMs, post the announcement of the results, for any tampering or modification, on a written request made by candidates at SI.No.2 or 3, behind the highest polled candidate. [Para 76] Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 – r.49MA – Petitioner pleaded that r.49MA is draconian, arbitrary, and contrary to law as reference to s.177, Penal Code, 1860 in the written declaration u/r.49MA is wrong and misconceived: Held: r.49MA permits the elector to raise a complaint if she/he is of the view that the VVPAT paper slip did not depict the correct candidate/political party she/he voted – However, whenever a challenge is made, the voting process must be halted – An overly liberal approach could cause confusion and delay hindering the election process and dissuading others from casting their votes – However, no comments made on the application of s.177, Penal Code, 1860 – ECI stated that only 26 such requests in terms of r.49MA were received, and in all cases, the allegation was found to be incorrect – Plea that any elector should be liberally permitted as a routine to ask for verification of vote, rejected.
