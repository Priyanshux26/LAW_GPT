The IMDT Act which contravenes Article 355 of the Constitutional, is therefore, wholly unconstitutional and must be struck down.” 82. The IMDT Act and Rules were held to be unconstitutional on the following grounds: a. The procedure under the Foreigners Act and the Foreigners (Tribunals) 1964 is more effective for the identification and deportation of foreigners than the procedure prescribed by 135 Referred to the Statement of Dr Nagendra Singh, India’s representative in the Sixth Committee of the General Assembly on the Definition of Aggression; [2005] Supp. 1 SCR 472 : (2005) 5 SCC 665 [52-60] 136 [2005] Supp. 1 SCR 472 : (2005) 5 SCC 665 [63] “Having regard to this constitutional mandate, the question arises whether the Union of India has taken any measures for that purpose.” 1288 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the IMDT Act and the Rules.137 In particular, Section 9 of the Foreigners Act places the burden of proof of being an Indian citizen on the person concerned. The provisions of the IMDT Act and Rules are silent on the onus of proof; b. In Assam, where the IMDT Act is applicable, only 10,015 persons were declared illegal migrants until 30 April 2000 though 3,10,759 inquiries were initiated. However, in West Bengal where the Foreigners Act is applicable, 4,89,046 persons were deported between 1983 and November 1998. Thus, the numbers indicated that the implementation of the IMDT Act and Rules in Assam has made the identification and deportation of illegal migrants more difficult;138 and c. The IMDT Act superseded the Immigrants (Expulsion from Assam) Act 1950 and the Passport (Entry into India) Act 1920 which granted the Central Government the power to remove any person who entered Assam and who was detrimental to the interests of the State, and those who entered without a valid passport, respectively.139 83. In addition to the violation of Article 355, this Court also found the IMDT Act and Rules to be violative of Article 14 on the ground that if the purpose was to control the influx of Bangladeshi migrants to Assam, provisions which are more stringent would have to be made. This Court noted that, the provisions of the IMDT Act and Rules were more lenient than the Foreigners Act which applied to the rest of India, where the problem was not as grave as in Assam.140 Thus, this Court held that there was no nexus between the object sought to be achieved and the means adopted by the enactment and Rules. 84.

Union of India,141 the constitutional validity of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act 137 [2005] Supp. 1 SCR 472 : (2005) 5 SCC 665 [64] 138 ibid 139 [2005] Supp. 1 SCR 472 : (2005) 5 SCC 665 [65] 140 “70. […] “In such circumstances, if Parliament had enacted a legislation exclusively for the State of Assam which was more stringent than the Foreigners Act, which is applicable to rest of India […] such a legislation would have passed the test of Article 14 as the differentiation so made would have had rational nexus with the avowed policy and objective of the Act.” 141 [1997] Supp.
