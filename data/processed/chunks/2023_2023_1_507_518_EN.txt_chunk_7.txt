The Petitioners have moved these proceedings virtually at the end F of the deadline for the payment of the second instalment which falls due on 21 November 2012. If this petition were to be instituted much before the approaching deadline, directions could have been issued for the disposal of the representation well in time before the approaching deadline for the second G instalment. In these circumstances and particularly in a contractual area where the parties are governed by an agreement dated 22 May 2012 in support of which the Petitioners have also tendered an undertaking, it will not be possible for the Court to pass any which would obviate compliance with the agreement….” H THE CHIEF ENGINEER, WRD v. RATTAN INDIA POWER LTD.THROUGH 517 ITS DIRECTOR [PAMIDIGHANTAM SRI NARASIMHA, J. ] The High Court merely directed the concerned authority to take a A decision on the representations made by Respondent No.1 within a period of eight weeks, and if the same came to be decided in the favor of Respondent No.1, then Respondent No.1 could take such measures in law to seek a refund. It is evident that the High Court refrained from granting a stay on the payment of the second instalment.In compliance B with the direction of the High Court, the Government considered the matter and it rejected the representation on 29.01.2013. In that view of the matter, we are of the opinion that the High Court committed an error in entertaining a fresh writ petition, which effectively claimed the same reliefs as of the previous one. The High Court committed a mistake in C not only entertaining the writ petition, but also in supplanting its viewover that of the contract. 21. As has been noted above, irrigation restoration charges were to be paid by Respondent No.1 in five installments. D E F Clause 4 of the undertaking dated 22.05.2012 which was issued by Respondent No.1 stated that if there is a delay in making the payment, then penal interest @12% p.a. shall be levied.The records before us indicate that that only two instalments have been paid. Therefore, we G direct that the balance amountdue and payable towards irrigation restoration charge shall pe paid by Respondent No.1 on or before 30.06.2023. Further, interest @ 12% p.a. shall be payable from the date the instalment/payment fell due till the date of the impugned i.e., 05.05.2016. H 518 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A 22. In conclusion, we allow the Civil Appeal No. 8550 of 2022 arising out of SLP (C) No.28161 of 2016 and set aside the impugned final judgement and dated 05.05.2016 passed by the High Court of Judicature of Bombay at Nagpur in W.P. No. 4968 of 2015. 23. Parties shall bear their own costs. B Devika Gujral Appeal allowed. C D E F G H
