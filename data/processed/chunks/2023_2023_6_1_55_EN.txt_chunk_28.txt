The scheme of CrPC is such that once the stage of investigation is completed, the court proceeds to the next stage, which is the taking of cognizance and trial. During the period of investigation, the accused is under the F custody of the Magistrate before whom he or she is first produced, with such Magistrate being vested with the power to remand the accused to police custody and/or judicial custody, up to a maximum period as prescribed under Section 167(2) of the CrPC. Acknowledging the fact that an accused has to remain in custody of some court, this Court G concluded that on filing of the chargesheet within the stipulated period, the accused continues to remain in the custody of the Magistrate till such time as cognizance is taken by the court trying the offence, when the said court assumes custody of the accused for purposes of remand during the trial in terms of Section 309 of the CrPC. This Court clarified that the two stages are different, with one following the other so as to H maintain continuity of the custody of the accused with a court. JUDGEBIR SINGH @ JASBIR SINGH SAMRA @ JASBIR 39 v. NATIONAL INVESTIGATION AGENCY [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] 55. We refer to the relevant portions of Suresh Kumar A Bhikamchand Jain (supra) as under: “16. At this juncture, we may refer to certain dates which are relevant to the facts of this case, namely: (a) 11-3-2012 — The petitioner arrested and remanded to B police custody; (b) 25-4-2012 — First charge-sheet filed against the four accused; (c) 1-6-2012 — Supplementary charge-sheet filed in which the petitioner is named; C (d) 30-7-2012 — The trial court rejected the petitioner’s prayer for grant of bail; (e) 13-9-2012 [Suresh v. State of Maharashtra, Criminal Application No. 3568 of 2012, dated 13-9-2012 (Bom)] — The High Court confirmed the of the trial court; D (f) 2-10-2012 — Application filed under Section 167(2) CrPC before the trial court; (g) 5-10-2012 — The trial court rejected the application under Section 167(2) CrPC. E From the above dates, it would be evident that both the charge- sheet as also the supplementary charge-sheet were filed within 90 days from the date of the petitioner’s arrest and remand to police custody. It is true that cognizance was not taken by the Special Court on account of failure of the prosecution to F obtain sanction to prosecute the accused under the provisions of the PC Act, but does such failure amount to non-compliance with the provisions of Section 167(2) CrPC is the question with which we are confronted. 17. In our view, grant of sanction is nowhere contemplated G under Section 167 CrPC. What the said section contemplates is the completion of investigation in respect of different types of cases within a stipulated period and the right of an accused to be released on bail on the failure of the investigating authorities to do so. The scheme of the provisions relating to remand of an accused, first during the stage of investigation H 40 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R.
