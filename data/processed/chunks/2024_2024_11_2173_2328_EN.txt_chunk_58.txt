Supreme Court Reports from the judge’s conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to his or her impartiality.”199 The objective test takes into consideration hierarchical and other links between a judge and the parties to the proceedings. The ECtHR’s approach, therefore, emphasizes determining “whether the relationship in question is of such a nature and degrees as to indicate a lack of impartiality on the part of the tribunal.”200 The real possibility of bias test as evolved by the English courts is in alignment with the bias test evolved by the ECHR.201 The ECtHR has held that an arbitration agreement does not constitute a waiver of the fair procedure guarantees contained in Article 6, particularly the right to have disputes settled by an independent and impartial tribunal.202 iv. Indian approach to the bias test 103. This Court has consistently adopted the real likelihood test to determine bias.203 In Manak Lal v. Dr. Prem Chand Singhvi,204 Justice P B Gajendragadkar (as the learned Chief Justice then was) observed that the test to determine bias is whether a litigant could reasonably apprehend that a bias attributable to a member of the tribunal might have operated against him in the final decision. In S Parthasarathi v. State of AP,205 Justice KK Mathew observed that the test of likelihood of bias is based on the reasonable apprehension of a reasonable man fully cognizant of the facts. The learned Judge further observed that the question of whether the real likelihood of bias exists is to be determined on the probabilities to be inferred from the objective circumstances by a court or based on impressions that might reasonably be left on the minds of the aggrieved party or the public at large.206 The legal development under 199 Morice v.

[It was observed: “16. The tests of “real likelihood” and “reasonable suspicion” are really inconsistent with each other. We think that the reviewing authority must make a determination on the basis of the whole evidence before it, whether a reasonable man would in the circumstances infer that there is real likelihood of bias. The Court must look at the impression which [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2247 Central Organisation for Railway Electrification v. M/s ECI SPIC SMO MCML (JV) A Joint Venture Company English law about the real danger of bias test was also accepted by this Court. 104. In Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam Ltd. v. Girja Shankar Pant,207 this Court observed that the real danger of bias is essentially based on deciding bias based on the facts and circumstances of the individual case.208 In M P Special Police Establishment v. State of M P,209 a Constitution Bench referred with approval to Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam Ltd. (supra).
