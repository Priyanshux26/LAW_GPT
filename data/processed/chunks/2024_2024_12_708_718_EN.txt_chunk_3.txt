(2) the Prescribed Authority shall thereupon cause to be served upon every such tenure-holder in such manner as may be prescribed, a notice together with a copy of the statement prepared under sub-section (1) calling upon him to show cause within a period specified in the notice, why the statement be not taken as correct. The period specified shall not be less than ten days from the date of service of the notice” Since the respondents did not submit a statement in terms of Section 9, the Prescribed Authority prepared a statement taking into consideration the entire land of the tenure holder and then a notice was issued under Section 10(2) of the Act of 1960 to the main recorded land owner i.e., Shri Hari Shankar Tiwari on 16.03.1974 by the Prescribed Authority as to why from his large land holding a portion be not declared as surplus. Late Shri Hari Shankar Tiwari (father of the present respondent no.1) filed his objections wherein he stated that there has been a family settlement which was arrived at between the parties way back in the year 1967 and according to this family settlement, shares of all the family members have already been determined. Moreover, this settlement has also been reduced to writing way back in the year 1969 and in the year 1970 one of the sons of Late Shri Hari Shankar Tiwari had also instituted a suit in the Court of Civil Judge, Junior Division in respect of non-agricultural properties, which were also then included in the memorandum of family settlement. The said suit was decreed on 02.11.1970 and on the basis of family settlement and memorandum dated 09.11.1969, the land has been divided and share of each family member is demarcated. A suit was also filed on 30.01.1971 for permanent 714 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports injunction for restraining Late Shri Hari Shankar Tiwari (father of the respondent no.1) from interfering in the agricultural lands on the basis of the family settlement. The suit was decreed on 09.08.1971. In other words, what was projected through family settlement and court cases was that now each family member has a separate share duly demarcated and therefore all of this cannot be clubbed and taken as the holding of only one tenure holder i.e. Hari Shankar Tiwari for the purpose of declaration of surplus land. The Prescribed Authority, however, after hearing all the objections came to the conclusion that the family settlement cannot be relied upon and passed an in the year 1974 declaring 37 Bigha 5 Biswa and 17.8 Biswansi on Late Hari Shankar Tiwari (father of the respondent no.1) as surplus under the provisions of the Act of 1960. 4. Against the said of the year 1974, an appeal was filed by Late Shri Hari Shankar Tiwari before the District Judge Hardoi, which was partly allowed by reducing the surplus land of late Hari Shankar Tiwari to 33 bigha 8 biswa and 14.8 biswansi and the file was sent back to the Prescribed Authority by an dated 24.09.1975.
