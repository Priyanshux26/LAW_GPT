On 10.02.2012 the appellant moved an application before this Court seeking modifi cation of its dated 06.01.2012 by issuing a direction to the High Court to dispose of Writ Appeal No. 2458 of 2010. It was contended that the fi ling of a Special Leave Petition against the of the learned Single Judge was not proper as a writ appeal should have been fi led. That admittedly, Writ Appeal No. 2458 of 2010 was pending before the High Court and the Revenue suppressed this vital information while fi ling the Special Leave Petition. This Court by way of an dated 21.02.2012 recalled its earlier dated 06.01.2012 passed in SLP (C) CC No. 19663 of 2010 and directed the High Court to dispose of Writ Appeal No. 2458 of 2010 within a period of two months. 2.13. Following the same, a Division Bench of the High of Karnataka vide dated 06.07.2012 dismissed the Writ Appeal preferred by the appellant and upheld the passed by the learned Single Judge. It was observed that the of the learned Single Judge remanding the matter to the Settlement Commission for adjudication did not suff er from any material irregularity or illegality. The pertinent observations of the Division Bench of the High of Karnataka are as under: i. On the question as to whether the dated 20.05.2010 passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court in Writ Petition No. 12239 of 2008 would call for interference, on a reading of Section 245C (1) of the Act which governs the fi ling of an application by an assessee seeking settlement it was observed that the application made by an assessee, must contain full and true disclosure of his income which has not been disclosed before the Assessing Offi cer. Further, on perusal of Section 245H of the Act which discusses the Commission’s power to grant immunity from prosecution and penalty, it was observed that necessary ingredients for granting immunity from prosecution would be: (a) the assessee should have co-operated with the Settlement Commission in the proceedings before it; and (b) the assessee should have made a full and true disclosure of its income and the manner in which such income has been derived. ii. Under Section 245H (1), the Settlement Commission, if satisfi ed that any assessee who makes the application for settlement 12 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. under Section 245C, has co-operated with the Commission in the proceedings before it and has made a full and true disclosure of its income and the manner in which such income has been derived, may grant immunity from prosecution and also from the imposition of penalty, either wholly or in part with respect to the case covered by the settlement. Thus, Section 245H (1) cannot be read in isolation as Section 245C is embedded in 245H (1), and hence, both the Sections must be read harmoniously. Further, if in a given case such immunity is not granted, the Revenue would proceed to prosecute the assessee in a jurisdictional court.
