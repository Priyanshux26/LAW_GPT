6. Similarly, the non-woven bag association also made representations on 23.08.2018 and 19.09.2018 to the TNPCB, which were rejected on similar grounds on 08.12.20185 through a clarifi cation issued by TNPCB and a further detailed clarifi cation issued by the State Government, that such non-woven bags were also banned. The reasoning given was that such bags are made of polypropylene, and do not degrade easily in natural environment. 7. Aggrieved by the ban, the paper cup association challenged the Notifi cation before the NGT which was dismissed6 on the ground that the challenge was not maintainable before the NGT. 5 The CIPET report concluded that “polypropylene is a synthetic plastic which is spun into fi bres and bonded together by chemical or solvent treatment as non-woven fabric”. 6 dated 28.01.2019 in Appeal Diary No. 05/2018 before the NGT, Principal Bench, New Delhi. 113 8 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. 8. Approaching the High Court in its writ jurisdiction, the appellants cited their rights under Article 14, and Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. Their principal grounds were: fi rstly, that the reports relied upon by the State recognised that the paper cups were recyclable provided the paper and LDPE plastic layer were separated (which the association was willing to assist/support), and this product was not on the same footing as other plastic products banned. It was also emphasised that this action was taken without application of mind and would have a vast economic impact on the livelihood of 5-6 lakhs of employees. Secondly, that the mandatory consultative mechanism captured in Rule 4 of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 (hereafter ‘1986 Rules’) – of publishing a draft notifi cation, inviting objections and passing a fi nal notifi cation after considering these – was not followed. 9. Arguments on behalf of the non-woven bag industry were that these bags were water and air permeable, and hence did not choke drains. They were eco-friendly alternatives that could be used more than 10 times and were recyclable; they had not been banned anywhere else in the world and had wide usage and application. 10. The High Court heard the writs along with various petitions fi led by other aggrieved manufacturers from the plastic industries, and dismissed them by common , upholding the ban.7 It agreed with other courts (namely, the Delhi High Court, Madhya Pradesh Court8, NGT9) as having rightly upheld the State’s competence to pass such government s under Section 5 of the EPA, in furtherance of its policy decision; judicial review of which, was limited.10 On the question of non-woven bags, the 7 The High Court noted that various other writ petitions (WP No. 34065/2018 dd. 27.12.2018, WP No. 24623/2018 dd. 19.12.2018, WP (MD) No. 10131/2018 dd. 03.12.2018) either challenging the validity of impugned government , or seeking its implementation, were dismissed by coordinate benches of the court. 8 Popular Plastic and Ors. v.
