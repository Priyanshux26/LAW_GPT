9 sub- rule (5) of the SARFAESI Rules by the appellant bank after having recovered its dues from the subsequent sale amounts to unjust enrichment – Whether, the forfeiture of the entire amount towards the earnest-money deposit under Rule 9(5) of the Rules amounts to unjust enrichment: Held: The consequence of forfeiture of 25% of the deposit under Rule 9(5) of the SARFAESI Rules is a legal consequence that has been statutorily provided in the event of default in payment of the balance amount – The consequence envisaged under Rule 9(5) follows irrespective of whether a subsequent sale takes place at a higher price or not, and this forfeiture is not subject to any recovery already made or to the extent of the debt owed – In such cases, no extent of equity can either substitute or dilute the statutory consequence of forfeiture of 25% of deposit under Rule 9(5) of the SARFAESI Rules – The High Court erred in law by holding that forfeiture of the entire deposit under Rule 9 sub-rule (5) of the SARFAESI Rules by the appellant bank after having already recovered its dues from the subsequent sale amounts to unjust enrichment. [Paras 111, 113] Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 – Security Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002 – Contract Act, 1872 – Whether a case of exceptionable circumstances could be said to have been made out by the respondent to set aside the of forfeiture of the earnest money deposit: 14 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Held: Where extraneous conditions exist that might have led to the inability of the successful auction purchaser despite best efforts from depositing the balance amount to no fault of its own, in such cases the earnest-money deposited by such innocent successful auction purchaser could certainly be asked to be refunded – In the instant case, it is the respondent’s case that he was unable to make the balance payment owing to the advent of the demonetization – The same led to a delay in raising the necessary finance – It has been pleaded by the respondent that the appellant bank failed to provide certain documents to him in time as a result of which he was not able to secure a term loan – However, the aforesaid by no stretch can be said to be an exceptional circumstance warranting judicial interference – Because demonetization had occurred much before the e-auction was conducted by the appellant bank – As regards the requisition of documents, the sale was confirmed on 07.12.2016, and the respondent first requested for the documents only on 20.12.2016, and the said documents were provided to him by the appellant within a month’s time i.e., on 21.01.2017 – It may also not be out of place to mention that the respondent was granted an extension of 90-days’ time period to make the balance payment, and was specifically reminded that no further extension would be granted, in-spite of this the respondent failed to make the balance payment – The e-auction notice inviting bids along with the correspondence between the appellant bank and the respondent are unambiguous and clearly spelt out the consequences of not paying the balance amount within the specified period.
