The said shall continue till the Screening Committee completes the process of screening.” 7. The appellant too carried the matter from the Tribunal to this Court. His matter was disposed of on 15.02.1996 in the following terms:- “These appeals relate to regular absorption of the appellants who are working as substitute teachers in the Railways. In the impugned the Central Administrative Tribunal has observed that the appellants should be given an opportunity to appear before the Selection Board if they are otherwise eligible as and when such selection is SAMIR KUMAR MAJUMDER v. 259 THE UNION OF INDIA & ORS. [K.V.VISWANATHAN, J.] made and has expressed the hope that the respondents would try to accommodate them even on temporary basis if there happens to be any casual vacancy available from time to time and for that purpose they may be placed on waiting list of substitute teachers. The submission of Shri Puri, the learned counsel appearing for the appellants, is that the appellants who have crossed the age bar may not be eligible for such consideration. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of these cases, it is directed that if the appellants have crossed the prescribed maximum age, they may be considered for regular selection by giving relaxation in that regard. But such relaxation shall be confi ned to one opportunity for consideration for such selection. The appeals are disposed of accordingly. No as to costs.” 8. Even though textually, the s may appear different, the respondent-authorities rightly acted in terms of the true purport of the . They subjected the appellant also to the process of screening by the Screening Committee in accordance with para 5.1 of the Master Circular dated 29.01.1991 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Master Circular dated 29.01.1991’) 9. After subjecting the appellant for screening, by an of 02.01.1998, the appellant was appointed as Primary Teacher (Bengali Medium) in the Railway Higher Secondary School, Alipurduar Junction against an existing vacancy. 10. Being aggrieved, the appellant filed Original Application No. 978 of 1998 before the Central Administrative Tribunal, Calcutta Bench. 11. The grievance was that fi rstly, the appellant should have been absorbed in the post of Assistant Teacher instead of being absorbed as a Primary Teacher with admissible continuity of service in the pay-scale of Rs.5500-9000 and not Rs.4500-7000 that was now off ered under the 02.01.1998 ; secondly, the appellant is entitled to the pay-scale and allowance admissible to the post of Assistant Teacher Grade-I, namely, Rs.1640-2900 from 05.12.1989 instead of the pay-scale of Rs.1200-2040 that was off ered. Thirdly, that under the Master Circular dated 29.01.1991, 260 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. a Substitute School Teacher who acquires temporary status, after putting in continuous service for three months, is entitled to continuity in service as prescribed therein. 12. At this stage, we can profi tably refer the dated 28.12.1998 passed on the aspect of continuity of service with regard to these teachers who were currently absorbed. The reads as under: “Sub:- Continuity of Service on regular absorption In compliance with of Hon’ble Supreme Court of India and CAT/Guwahati dated 13-10-95, 15-2-96.
