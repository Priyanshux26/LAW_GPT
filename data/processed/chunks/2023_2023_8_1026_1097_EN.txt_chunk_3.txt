B Practice and Procedure – For all the accused in the PMLA case, arguments were advanced for the grant of larger reliefs than what they got under the impugned , without even filing any appeal against the same – Held: It is possible in law for a successful party (though in civil proceedings) to support the decree without C supporting the – But what the accused sought to do before Supreme Court was to support the and seek an enlargement of the decree, without independently filing appeals – Since they took a chance by adopting such a course, they may not even be able to challenge the impugned hereafter, once the seal of D approval on the same is affixed by this Court and the doctrine of merger comes into play – Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Doctrines/Principles – Doctrine of merger. Disposing of the appeals, the Court HELD: 1. The directing de novo investigation in all E the three cases, has actually inured to the benefit of the accused, but the High Court put it on the ground that the credibility of the investigation should not be eroded. In fact, the accused did not seek de novo investigation on the ground of slackness on the part of the Investigating Officer, but it was ‘D’ who sought it, with the able assistance of the Investigating Officer. The fact that F ‘D’s petition was intended to help the accused is also borne out by one more fact. His original complaint dated 29.10.2015 which led to the registration of FIR in Crime No.441 of 2015 was against ten persons and the offences registered therein were only under Sections 406 and 420 read with Section 34 IPC. On this complaint, G a Final Report was filed under Section 173(2) of the Code on 13.06.2017 and this resulted in the registration of Calendar Case in CC No.3627 of 2017. ‘D’ was happy with the fact that the Report filed under Section 173(2) did not include the offences under the PC Act. ‘D’ was not bothered at that time about the fact that the register for entering the interview marks, sent to the Forensic H Y. BALAJI v. KARTHIK DESARI & ANR. ETC. 1031 Department had not been received. Suddenly, he became worked A up after the filing of the Report under Section 173(8) leading to the registration of Calendar Case No.24 of 2021 including the offences under the PC Act. What is shocking is that the High Court directed reinvestigation to be started ab initio, wiping out the earlier investigation altogether. One saving grace in this case B is that even the learned senior counsel appearing for ‘D’ and the learned senior counsel appearing for the accused could not support the operative portion of the impugned dated 31.10.2022, in Criminal O.P. No.15122 of 2021. By issuing the aforesaid direction, the High Court not only directed the wiping out of the investigation carried out so far, but virtually wiped out C even the of this Court dated 08.09.2022 passed in Criminal Appeal Nos.1514-1516 of 2022.
