In the present case, the exclusion of old Indian settlers, who have settled D in Sikkim prior to the merger of Sikkim with India on 26.04.1975 from the definition of “Sikkimese” in Section 10(26AAA) does not fulfill the aforesaid two conditions. 13.3 As observed and held by this Court in the case of Manohar Singhji (supra), Article 14 declares that “the State shall not deny to E any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India”. It is observed that such an obvious discrimination can be supported only on the ground that it was based upon a reasonable classification. A proper classification must always bear a reasonable and just relation to the things in respect of which it is proposed. Judged by those criteria, it seems to us that the discrimination F is based on no classification at all and is manifestly baseless, unreasonable and arbitrary. 13.4 In the present case, as observed hereinabove, the exclusion has no nexus with the object and purpose of enacting Section 10(26AAA) of the Income Tax Act to be achieved. No reasonable intelligible G differentia has been shown and therefore, the same can be termed as arbitrary. As observed and held by this Court in the case of Shayara Bano Vs. Union of India, (2017) 9 SCC 1, in India, arbitrariness is not a separate ground since it will come within the embargo of Article 14 of the Constitution. Therefore, any provision, which is arbitrary, H 314 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India and any classification which is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India can be struck down. 14. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, we are of the firm opinion that Section 10(26AAA) to the extent it excludes the Old Indian settlers, who have settled in Sikkim prior to the merger of B Sikkim with India on 26.04.1975, but whose names are not recorded as “Sikkim Subjects”, from the definition of “Sikkimese” is ultra vires, being arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The definition of “Sikkimese” in Section 10(26AAA) of the Income Tax Act shall also include all Indians, who have permanently settled in C Sikkim prior to the merger of Sikkim with India on 26.04.1975 irrespective of the fact that whether their names have been recorded in the register maintained under the Sikkim Subjects Regulations, 1961 or not. Therefore, it is held that the “Sikkimese” like the petitioners, who are old Indian settlers and who have settled in Sikkim prior to the merger of Sikkim with India on 26.04.1975 shall also be entitled to the exemption under D Section 10(26AAA) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. 15. Now, so far as the challenge to the Proviso to Section 10(26AAA) insofar as it excludes from the exempted category, “a Sikkimese woman, who marries a non-Sikkimese after 01.04.2008” is concerned, there is no justification shown and/or demonstrated to exclude E “a Sikkimese woman, who marries a non-Sikkimese after 01.04.2008” from the exempted category.
