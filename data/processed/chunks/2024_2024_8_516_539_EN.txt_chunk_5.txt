Digital Supreme Court Reports 14. Learned counsel further contended that the responsibility to devise a suitable scheme for the regularisation of employees who have served for more than ten years lies with the respondents i.e., the State. She submitted that the respondent had rejected the appellants’ representation on a purely arbitrary ground that they were not appointed through a rigorous selection process and that the CCS (Conduct) Rules, 1964 did not apply to them. She urged that the appointment of the appellants was conducted under due process of selection, following the rules of the Cabinet Secretariat, and cannot be deemed irregular or illegal simply for the lack of statutory recruitment and service rules. Learned counsel in this regard placed reliance upon the decision of this Court in the case of the State of Karnataka & Ors. v. M.L. Kesari & Ors.1 15. Learned counsel further submitted that the case of the appellants is squarely covered by the principle of “equal pay for equal work” and that the right of equal wages conferred upon temporary employees flows, inter alia, from Article 39 of the Constitution of India. This principle of “equal pay for equal work” expounded through various decisions of this Court constitutes the law, which is binding upon all the Courts in India and consequently upon the respondents. It also extends to temporary employees performing the same duties and responsibilities as regular employees. Learned counsel in this regard placed reliance upon the decisions of this Court in the cases of Surinder Singh and Another v. Engineer-in-Chief, C.P.W.D. and Another,2 State of Punjab & Ors. v. Jagjit Singh & Ors.,3 Union of India v. Dineshan K.K.,4 and Randhir Singh v. Union of India & Ors.5 On these grounds, learned counsel for the appellants implored the Court to accept the appeal, set aside the impugned s and direct the respondents to release in favour of the appellants, the benefits of the replacement scales set out in the RP Rules issued in pursuance of the 6th CPC report with effect from 1st January, 2006. 1 [2010] 9 SCR 543 : (2010) 9 SCC 247 2 (1986) 1 SCC 639 3 [2016] 7 SCR 350 : (2017) 1 SCC 148 4 [2008] 1 SCR 100 : (2008) 1 SCC 586 5 [1982] 3 SCR 298 : (1982) 1 SCC 618 [2024] 8 S.C.R. 525 Rajkaran Singh & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors. Submissions on behalf of the Respondents: - 16. Mr. K.M. Nataraj, learned ASG, representing the respondents, vehemently and fervently opposed the submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant. He submitted that the SSD Fund is a welfare scheme, introduced with effect from 1st October 1964, for force personnel on the analogy of the Armed Force Personnel Provident Fund to cater to their welfare measures. It is a contributory fund subscribed by force personnel for their better future and no government funds are involved in the SSD Fund, thereby, establishing a clear alienation from the Central government. The government has no control what to talk of deep and pervasive control over the affairs of the fund.
