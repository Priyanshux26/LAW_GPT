CONCIUSION ANd DITCCTIONS. ..........................-------------------- 149 [2024] 2 S.C.R. 452 Digital Supreme Court Reports The petitioners have instituted proceedings under Article 32 of the Constitution challenging the constitutional validity of the Electoral Bond Scheme’ which introduced anonymous financial contributions to political parties. The petitioners have also challenged the provisions of the Finance Act 2017? which, among other things, amended the provisions of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934°, the Representation of the People Act 19514, the Income Tax Act 1961°, and the Companies Act 20137, A. Background Section 31 of the RBI Act stipulates that only the RBI or the Central Government authorized by the RBI Act shall draw, accept, make, or issue any bill of exchange or promissory note for payment of money to the bearer of the note or bond. The Finance Act amended the RBI Act by including Section 31 (3) which permits the Central Government to authorize any scheduled bank to issue electoral bonds. To understand the context in which the legislative amendments were introduced, it is necessary to juxtapose the amendments with the regime on financial contributions to political parties. The law relating to financial contributions to political parties focusses on (a) contributions by corporate entities; (0) disclosure of information on contributions; and (c) income tax exemptions for donations. |. Corporate Contributions The Companies Act 1956 and the provisions of the RPA, when they were enacted did not regulate contributions to political parties by companies and individuals. The Companies (Amendment) Act 1960 included Section 293A’ to regulate contributions by companies. = DW + Oo ON “Electoral Bond Scheme” or “Scheme” “Finance Act” Section 135 of the Finance Act 2017; “RBI Act” Section 137 of the Finance Act 2017;“RPA” Section 11 of the Finance Act 2017; “IT Act” Section 154 of the Finance Act 2017; “Companies Act” “293A.
