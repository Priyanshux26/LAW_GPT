1 GG is made by the Federal President. In the US, under Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution, the President, as Head of State, declares the consent of the United States to be bound by the treaty under international law. This power is ordinarily delegated to the Secretary of State or a US Ambassador. 46. The method by which the Contracting States declare their consent is left to the Contracting Parties (Article 11 et seq. VCLT). For important treaties, however, it is generally agreed that the conclusion of the treaty shall be given eff ect only through an exchange of instruments, or ‘ratifi cation’ (Article 14(1) VCLT); for multilateral treaties, it is by deposit of instruments at a location agreed upon in the treaty through corresponding notifi cation (Articles 14(1), 16 VCLT). Ratifi cation is to be distinguished from parliamentary consent (see above), which frequently, primarily in the language of the media, is incorrectly termed as ‘ratifi cation’. Article 31 of the OECD MC, Article 30 of the UN MC and Article 29 of the US MC each provide for ratifi cation of tax treaties and treaties normally follow the MC in this respect. In the document of ratifi cation, the authorized agent - the President in the US, the Federal President in Germany, Austria and Switzerland – delivers the 47 Klaus Vogel on Double Taxation Conventions 119 6 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. formal declaration that the constitutional requirements necessary for internal application of the treaty have been fulfi lled (see infra Article 31 at m.no. 11 et seq.). *************** ************* 47. Upon declaration of intent to contract, whether through ratifi cation or other means, the treaty becomes binding under international law (unless the treaty provides for a diff erent date for entry into force). The binding force of the treaty under international law is to be distinguished from its internal applicability. Internal applicability is a consequence only of treaties which - like tax treaties - are designed to be applied by domestic authorities in addition to obligating the States themselves (i.e., self-executing treaties).48 *************** *************** 49. In the UK, where parliamentary consent is not necessary for conclusion of a treaty, the treaty becomes applicable internally only when a special law to this eff ect is passed by Parliament after the treaty enters into force under international law.49 In special, legally authorized cases, such as for DTCs under § 788 ICTA 1988, the Queen may enact an in Council in place of parliamentary legislation.50 A special law is also required in Canada51 and other members of the Commonwealth. Under Netherlands constitutional law, the treaty becomes applicable domestically at the time it enters into force,52 refl ecting the ‘monist’ theory of international law. In general, the confl ict between ‘monistic’ and ‘dualist’ theories has been overcome by a compromise view.53 48 GATT has been held by the German Bundesfi nanzhof not to be ‘self-executing’: 25 February, 1959, BStBl. III 166, 167 (1959); 15 October 1959, BStBl.
