Digital Supreme Court Reports from which he cannot be allowed to backtrack. It was canvassed that the same would amount to taking double advantage; one at the initial stage on the basis of the date of birth as 27.12.1948 and later in service on a different date of birth i.e., 12.03.1955. It was contended that the CGIT reaching the conclusion, that the management could not have determined the date of birth of the respondent no.3 based on the initial Descriptive Roll being unjustified, was totally without any basis and arbitrary and thus, awarding him 50% back wages, is totally misplaced and needs interference by this Court. It was urged that the High Court also failed to take notice of basic factual aspects and more importantly, the conduct of the respondent no.3 and the time-gap of 9 years after which he suddenly woke up and made a representation for change of his date of birth. SUBMISSIONS OF RESPONDENT NO.3: 12. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent no.3 submitted that at the time of filling up the Descriptive Roll, the same was based on an oral declaration and apparently the authority, which was noting down the date of birth, had committed an error. 13. It was further submitted that the STC dated 12.01.1972 clearly indicates that his date of birth was 12.03.1955, which required corrections in the records of the appellant and thus the CGIT and the High Court have not committed any error warranting interference by this Court. 14. It was submitted that the respondent no.3 was unaware of the date of birth being recorded as 27.12.1948 and only when he came to know of the same, he had taken steps and the CGIT rightly granted relief to him. 15. Learned counsel submitted that the respondent no.3 cannot be made to suffer for the fault of the appellant itself and more so when later, in its own records it had correctly recorded his date of birth as 12.03.1955, in the year 1982. ANALYSIS, CONCLUSION AND REASONING: 16. Having considered the matter in its entirety and the submissions made, this Court is of the opinion that the Award of the CGIT as well as the impugned rendered by the High Court cannot be [2024] 4 S.C.R. 69 The General Manager, M/S Barsua Iron Ore Mines v. The Vice President United Mines Mazdoor Union and Ors. sustained. It is not in dispute that while submitting the Descriptive Roll, the respondent no.3 had himself declared his age as 24 years without any documentary proof and since the date of submission of such Descriptive Roll was 27.12.1972, his date of birth was recorded by the appellant as 27.12.1948. This position continued for almost a decade viz. till 1982, when the respondent no.3 submitted a declaration, on the merger of HSL with SAIL, wherein his date of birth was disclosed as 12.03.1955, though even at such time, again, no documentary proof was furnished by him. The respondent no.3 submitted the so-called proof, which was the STC dated 12.01.1972, only after the issuance of letter dated 24.11.1998, whereby he was required to submit documentary proof of his date of birth.
