The sale held without examining this aspect and not in conformity with this mandatory requirement would be illegal and without jurisdiction. (See Ambati Narasayya v. M. Subba Rao [1989 Supp (2) SCC 693].) The duty cast upon the court to sell only such property or portion thereof as is necessary to satisfy the decree is a mandate of the legislature which cannot be ignored. Similar view has been expressed in S. Mariyappa v. Siddappa [(2005) 10 SCC 235]. 11 [2006] 2 SCR 363 : (2006) 3 SCC 49 [2024] 6 S.C.R. 649 Bhikchand S/o Dhondiram Mutha (Deceased) Through Lrs. v. Shamabai Dhanraj Gugale (Deceased) Through Lrs. 10. In S.S. Dayananda v. K.S. Nagesh Rao [(1997) 4 SCC 451] it was held that the procedural compliance with 21 Rule 64 of the Code is a mandatory requirement. This was also the view expressed in Desh Bandhu Gupta v. N.L. Anand [(1994) 1 SCC 131].” 24. In Ambati Narasayya vs. M. Subba Rao12 this Court has held that in auction sale this is obligatory on Court that only such portion of property as would satisfy decree is sold and not the entire property. This court observed thus in paras 6, 7 & 8: “6. The principal question that has been highlighted before us relates to the legality of the sale of 10 acres of land without considering whether a portion of the land could have been sold to satisfy the decree. It is said that the total sum claimed in the execution was Rs 2395.50. The relevant provision which has a bearing on the question is Rule 64 XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure and it reads as follows: - “ XXI Rule 64: Power to property attached to be sold and proceeds to be paid to persons entitled.—Any court executing a decree may that any property attached by it and liable to sale, or such portion thereof as may seem necessary to satisfy the decree, shall be sold, and that the proceeds of such sale, or a sufficient portion thereof, shall be paid to the party entitled under the decree to receive the same.” 7. It is of importance to note from this provision that in all execution proceedings, the court has to first decide whether it is necessary to bring the entire attached property to sale or such portion thereof as may seem necessary to satisfy the decree. If the property is large and the decree to be satisfied is small, the court must bring only such portion of the property, the proceeds of which would be sufficient to satisfy the claim of the decree holder. It is 12 [1989] Supp. 1 SCR 451 : 1989 Supp (2) SCC 693 650 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports immaterial whether the property is one, or several. Even if the property is one, if a separate portion could be sold without violating any provision of law only such portion of the property should be sold. This, in our opinion, is not just a discretion, but an obligation imposed on the court.
