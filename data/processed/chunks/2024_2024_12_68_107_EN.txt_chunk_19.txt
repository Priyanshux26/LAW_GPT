52. In a constitutional democracy, each branch of government—executive, legislative, and judiciary — has a defined role and operates within its designated boundaries. This separation of powers ensures that one branch does not encroach upon the functions of the others, preserving a system of checks and balances crucial to democratic governance. Within this framework, courts are primarily responsible for interpreting and upholding the law, while the executive and legislature hold the mandate to formulate and implement policy. This division is essential, as it aligns with the principle that policy-making, particularly in areas requiring specialized knowledge, foresight, and discretion, should remain within the domain of the elected representatives and those with the requisite expertise. 53. Judicial restraint is rooted in the understanding that courts should respect the decisions made by the legislative and executive branches, provided these decisions are legally sound and constitutionally valid. By adhering to judicial restraint, courts avoid overstepping their constitutional role and thereby prevent potential conflicts with the executive and legislative branches. The principle of separation of powers supports the idea that each branch has a unique role, and mutual respect between these branches is essential for the proper functioning of government. The courts are to ensure that laws and policies do not infringe upon citizens’ rights or exceed the authority granted by law. However, this role does not extend to evaluating whether a policy is “wise” or whether a better one could be devised, and rather this process is entrusted to the legislature and executive, which have the expertise to make these determinations. 54. The doctrine of judicial restraint, which is central to this discussion, emphasizes that courts should exercise caution and avoid involvement in policy decisions, as these are complex s that require a balancing of diverse and often competing interests. Policies are crafted based on thorough analysis of social, economic, and political factors, considerations beyond the court’s purview. The court is tasked with ensuring that policies do not breach constitutional provisions 96 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports or statutory limits; however, they should not replace policymakers’ s with their own unless absolutely necessary. 55. Policy decisions often require the expertise of professionals and specialists in fields such as economics, public health, national security, and environmental science. These domains involve specialized knowledge that judges, as generalists in legal matters, may lack. For instance, in economic policy, the executive may decide on trade tariffs or subsidies based on extensive data and projections that aim to balance domestic industry support with global trade commitments. The courts, lacking the same level of economic expertise and without the authority to make trade-offs among competing policy objectives, is typically not equipped to second-guess these kinds of decisions. 56. While courts have the power of judicial review to ensure that executive actions and legislative enactments comply with the Constitution, this power is not absolute. Judicial review is meant to act as a safeguard against actions that overstep legal boundaries or infringe on fundamental rights, but it does not entail a comprehensive re-evaluation of the policy’s wisdom.
