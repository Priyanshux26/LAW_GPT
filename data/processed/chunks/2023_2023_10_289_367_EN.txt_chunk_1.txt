Act, 1961 – Further, there is no justification shown and/or C demonstrated to exclude “a Sikkimese woman, who marries a non- Sikkimese after 01.04.2008” from the exempted category – The discrimination is based on gender which is wholly violative of Arts. 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution – To deny the benefit of exemption u/s. 10(26AAA) of the Income Tax Act to “a Sikkimese woman, who marries a non-Sikkimese after 01.04.2008” is arbitrary, D discriminatory and violative of Art. 14 – Therefore the Proviso to s.10(26AAA) insofar as it excludes from the exempted category “a Sikkimese woman, who marries a non-Sikkimese after 01.04.2008” has to be struck down – Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J. ): Under the 1961 Regulation, for women marriage has been the basis of E acquiring the status of having a domicile in Sikkim and being a Sikkim Subject or losing domicile or status as a Sikkim Subject – Marriage of a Sikkimese woman is also the basis for discrimination against her whereas there is no such discrimination vis-à-vis a Sikkimese man marrying a Sikkimese or a non-Sikkimese woman on or after 1st April, 2008 – When the Explanation to s.10(26AAA) F refers to an “individual”, it includes both Sikkimese men and women, in fact, all genders – Therefore, it cannot have a restrictive or myopic reference to only Sikkimese men and exclude those Sikkimese women – In the instant case, the proviso is overriding the provision as well as the Explanation in respect of those categories of married G Sikkimese women – The proviso is inherently arbitrary and discriminatory against a particular category of Sikkimese women – Hence, all Sikkimese women are entitled to the benefit of s.10(26AAA) as per the Explanation thereto irrespective of whether they marry a Sikkimese or a non-Sikkimese – The proviso to Clause(26AAA) of s. 10 of the I.T. Act, 1961 is struck down as being H ASSOCIATION OF OLD SETTLERS OF SIKKIM AND ORS. v. 291 UNION OF INDIA AND ANR. in violation of Arts. 14 and 15 – The object and purpose of the A exemption is only to exempt the settlers in Sikkim or persons domiciled in Sikkim in terms of the 1961 Regulation or the Government s – All individuals domiciled in Sikkim till 26th April, 1975 and who have since become citizens of India are entitled to exemption from payment of income tax – Only such individuals B are entitled to the exemption who fall within the three clauses of the Explanation – All other citizens of India who do not fall within the ambit of the Explanation and who have been domiciled in Sikkim State subsequent to 26th April, 1975 would not have the benefit of exemption – This would be discriminatory insofar as those settlers in Sikkim are concerned who have been domiciled in Sikkim C subsequent to promulgation of 1961 Regulation and till 26th April, 1975 – Such individuals are old settlers who have become citizens of India from 26th April, 1975 but who were domiciled in Sikkim prior to the said date – These old settlers are also entitled to the exemption under s.10 (26AAA) – Hence, directions in that regard D have to be issued to fill the Legislative vacuum and amendment to the Explanation is necessary – Directions issued to eliminate the discrimination and to save the Explanation from being rendered unconstitutional – Constitution of India – Arts.
