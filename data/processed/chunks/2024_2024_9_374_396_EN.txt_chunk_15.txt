• The technology provider must also look into reducing the transporting cost between slurry making facility at Baner and Talegaon plant by finding an optimum slurry density.” 50. We direct the appellant-Corporation and the respondent- Concessionaire to ensure that all the aforesaid suggestions made by NEERI should be strictly complied with. We further direct the appellant-Corporation to install the portable compactors with hook mechanisms so as to ensure that the reject waste does not touch the ground by 31st December 2024. 51. The appellant-Corporation is further directed to construct bitumen road to the Waste Segregation Plant and concrete the reject area 396 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports which will enhance clean transfer of waste and avoid accumulation of water around the Waste Segregation Plant. 52. We further direct the appellant-Corporation as well as the respondent- Concessionaire to construct a shed so as to cover the reject area by 31st December 2024. 53. We further direct the appellant-Corporation/respondent-Concessionaire to carry out plantation with thick density so that there would be a green cover on all the sides of the GPP. 54. A perusal of the sanctioned plan would reveal that, on one side, there is a reservation for the Bio-diversity Park. As such, the plantation would be required to be done to cover the three sides. 55. Insofar as the Bio-diversity Park is concerned, we direct the State Government to consider the possibility of growing Miyawaki forests so as to provide green lungs to the nearby areas. 56. We further direct the NEERI to conduct an environmental audit of the GPP every six months and in turn, the appellant-Corporation and the respondent-Concessionaire are directed to ensure that the suggestions made in the said audit are strictly complied with. 57. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the Case: Appeals allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
