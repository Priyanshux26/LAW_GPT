It stressed that the Government must report vacancies in a timely and efficient manner before KPSC initiates its selection process. Referring to its earlier in O.P. (KAT) No. 441/2020, the High Court reiterated that guidelines were already laid down regarding how vacancies must be reported and how the shortlist should be prepared. It concluded that once KPSC adheres to these directions during the preparation of the rank list, no authority, including the Government, Tribunal, or Courts, can interfere or direct expansion of the list. 13. Consequently, the High Court dismissed the petitions challenging KPSC’s refusal to expand the rank list, affirming that its decision was consistent with constitutional principles and within its jurisdiction. It upheld KPSC’s decision as within its autonomous jurisdiction and in alignment with constitutional principles and KPSC’s independent authority, as a constitutionally protected body tasked with ensuring merit-based and fair public employment. 14. We have heard Mr. Nikhil Goel, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants. No one has entered appearance on behalf of the respondents, despite service of notice. 15. Mr. Nikhil Goel, learned counsel for the appellants has made the following submissions: 15.1 The High Court overlooked the constitutional mandate and regulatory framework under Article 320(3), which excludes determination of the number of vacancies from the purview of the KPSC. The appellants pointed out that the notification issued in 2014 led to the creation of a rank list in 2020, valid until February 2023, during which time eligible candidates [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1155 Ajith G. Das & Others Etc. v. The State of Kerala & Others were reported. This notification expressly included all potential vacancies that might arise in future, considering the protracted selection process, which took six years, and the fact that no subsequent recruitment process had commenced. 15.2 The Government’s authority to notify the number of vacancies is not constrained to the period before publication of the rank list, as implied by the High Court. They asserted that such a restriction is not supported by the constitutional provisions or their plain reading. Furthermore, they highlighted that the KAT had, in its dated 28.11.2022, where both the Government and KPSC were respondents, recognized an extraordinary situation wherein numerous vacancies remained unfilled due to duplication of candidates’ names across different rank lists. This became final and was binding on the KPSC. The appellants criticized KPSC’s rejection of the Government’s recommendations, arguing that it effectively acted as an appellate authority without justification. 15.3 The High Court in the impugned failed to address the extraordinary situation of unfilled vacancies or the binding nature of the KAT’s , possibly due to the absence of active participation by the Government or KPSC in the proceedings. They further pointed out the limited scope of the present appeal, involving only 27 candidates who seek to fill vacancies without displacing others. Given the delay in initiating a new selection process, they urged this Court to consider the appeal on equitable grounds and allow these candidates to be appointed to the existing vacancies.
