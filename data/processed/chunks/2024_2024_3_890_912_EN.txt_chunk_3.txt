8. As no documents showing clearance of the goods contained in the 264 cases from within the warehouse but lying outside the warehouse on payment of duty and interest as required under Section 71 of the Customs Act could be produced, the said goods were seized in terms of Section 110 of the Customs Act. The value of the goods seized was estimated at Rs.48,79,776.00. [2024] 3 S.C.R. 895 M/s. Bisco Limited v. Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise 9. In his statement recorded under Section 108 of the Customs Act on 07.08.1992, Sh. Yashwant Singh Bisht, Project Officer (Commercial) of the appellant stated that the 264 cases of imported goods were kept outside the bond under a shed as the trailers transporting the goods could not enter the notified warehouse in view of the soil becoming very sluggish on account of heavy rains and also because of paucity of space. The Collector, therefore, opined that the appellant had removed the 264 cases of warehoused goods valued at Rs.48,79,776.00 attracting duty of Rs.39,03,821.00 and interest of Rs.18,88,425.00 in violation of Section 71 read with Section 111(j) of the Customs Act. The seized goods were thus held liable for confiscation. 10. It was further alleged that appellant had unauthorisedly cleared 27 cases of the imported goods valued at Rs.4,99,068.00 attracting duty of Rs.3,99,255.00 with interest of Rs.2,41,326.00 which were liable to be recovered under Section 71 read with the proviso to Section 28(1) of the Customs Act. 11. That apart, it was alleged that M/s. Central Warehousing Corporation, Pithampur had abetted the appellant in clearing the warehoused goods without payment of duty and interest. 12. In the above circumstances, a show cause notice dated 22.01.1993 was issued to the appellant as well as to the warehouse keeper by the Collector (now the Commissioner) to explain and show cause as to why: (i) the seized quantity of 264 cases of goods valued at Rs.48,79,776.00 and attracting duty of Rs.39,03,821.00 plus Rs.18,88,425.00 due to interest should not be confiscated in terms of Section 71 read with Section 111(j) of the Customs Act. (ii) the amount of duty of Rs.3,99,255.00 plus interest of Rs.2,41,326.00 payable on 27 cases of goods valued at Rs.4,99,068.00 cleared and utilized by the appellant, should not be demanded from the appellant in terms of Section 71 read with the proviso to Section 28 (1) of the Customs Act. (iii) a penalty under Section 112 of the Customs Act should not be imposed for violation of Section 71 and Section 111(j) of the Customs Act. 896 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 13. Appellant submitted reply dated 02.04.1994. In its reply, appellant stated that there was heavy rain in the month of August 1989 and the soil outside the notified warehouse had become very sluggish. As a result, the trailers carrying the consignment could not enter the notified warehouse. The goods were downloaded in the open outside the notified warehouse but within the factory premises. To prevent the goods from getting damaged, appellant had requested the concerned Superintendent of Customs and Central Excise to shift the machineries to under a shed within the factory premises under Section 64 of the Customs Act.
