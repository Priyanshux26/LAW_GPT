Article 246 confers exclusive power on Parliament to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I (the Union List) of the Seventh Schedule. The exclusive power of the State legislatures with respect to the matters enumerated in List II is subject to the exclusive legislative powers of Parliament. In Hoechst Pharmaceuticals v. State of Bihar,23 this Court culled out the following principles underlying Article 246: 23 [1983] 3 SCR 130 : (1983) 4 SCC 45 1610 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports a. Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to the matters enumerated in List I; b. The non-obstante clause in Article 246(1) provides for predominance or supremacy of the Union legislature; c. The legislative powers of the Union legislature is not encumbered by anything contained in Articles 246(2) and 246(3) for these clauses are expressly limited and made subject to the non- obstante clause in Article 246(1); d. The State legislature has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II; e. The exclusive power of the State legislature to legislate with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II has to be exercised subject to Article 246(1), that is, the exclusive power of Parliament to legislate with respect to matters enumerated in List I; f. Consequently, in case of any conflict between an entry in List I and an entry in List II which is not capable of reconciliation, the power of Parliament to legislate with respect to a matter enumerated in List I must supersede pro tanto the exercise of power of the State legislature; and g. Both Parliament and State legislatures have concurrent powers of legislation with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III, the law enacted by Parliament prevailing in the event of any inconsistency or conflict. 32. Article 245 (read with Article 246) is the source of the legislative powers of Parliament and the State legislatures. The entries in the Seventh Schedule delineate the subject matter over which the appropriate legislature can enact laws. The entries are legislative heads and not the source of legislative powers.24 A legislation could be composite in nature, drawing upon several entries in a particular list.25 Such a legislation is referred to as a “ragbag” legislation. 24 Calcutta Gas Company (Proprietary) Ltd v. State of West Bengal [1962] Supp 3 SCR 1, [8] 25 Ujagar Prints (II) v. Union of India (1989) 3 SCC 488 [53]; State of West Bengal v. Committee for Protection of Democratic Rights (2010) 3 SCC 571 [27]. [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1611 Mineral Area Development Authority & Anr. v. M/s Steel Authority of India & Anr. Etc. 33. Article 254 clarifies that if the law made by a State legislature is repugnant to any provisions of a law made by Parliament with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III, the law made by Parliament would prevail and the law made by the State legislature would be void to the extent of the repugnancy.
