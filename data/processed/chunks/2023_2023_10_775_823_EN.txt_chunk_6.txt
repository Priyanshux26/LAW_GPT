The (then) 3% reservations set aside for pesons with disabilities candidates no longer remains horizontal, but is implemented vertically. While the 2016 Act enables the State to work out this mechanism, such is conspicuously absent in the 1995 Act. [Para 12][821-F-G] B 1.4 This also leads to differential treatment of candidates belonging to the same backward class as recognized by Article 16(4) of the Constitution. An OBC candidate who is also a person with disabilities, will be given preference over a non-persons with disabilities OBC candidate in promotions, which is impermissible. C Additionally, on a reading of T. Devadasan and N.M. Thomas’s case, it is relevant to note that while reservations for backward classes are to be carried forward, the 2016 Act permits carrying forward of horizontal reservations for persons with disabilities candidates for a maximum period of two years. However, the amendment to the Constitution recognizes that ‘carry forward’ D vacancies can exceed the 50% limit in promotional vacancies. This amendment [inserting Article 16(4-B)] was upheld by this Court in M.Nagraj case. [Para 13][822-A-C] 1.5 The laudable intent behind a provision such as Section 33 of the 1995 Act, and Section 34 of the 2016 Act, is undeniable. E It is given that persons with disabilities need to be accommodated, in public service. At the same time, this reasonable accommodation ought not to open gates for demands by those benefitting other kinds of horizontal reservation, for reservation in promotional vacancies in public services.
