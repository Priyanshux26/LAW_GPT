C. IMPUGNED 15. Aggrieved with the aforesaid, the respondent went in appeal under Section 23 of the RCT Act before the High Court of judicature at Allahabad. In all 76 First Appeals from were filed, with the lead appeal being the FAO No. 843 of 2014 wherein the High Court vide its judgement & dated 23.02.2018 allowed the aforesaid appeal, by placing reliance on the decision of this Court in Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd. v. Union of India reported in (2018) 17 SCC 729. The High Court took the view that since in the case at hand the freight had been paid as per the notified chargeable distance which was later found to be incorrect, it was a case of “illegal charge” and not that of “overcharge”. The relevant observations read as under: - [2024] 3 S.C.R. 1067 Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. “[...] In this case, the freight was paid by the appellant as per the notified distance and freight charges were paid accordingly. However, later on it was revealed that the distance was less and that is how the appellants had claimed the amount. This was one of the facts on which the Apex Court held in favour of the appellant (Hindustan Petroleum) and this was a question of illegal realisation of freight and not of over charging as submitted by the counsel for the respondent. [...] The finding of fact by the Tribunal dismissing the claim of the claimant is bad in the eye of law as held by the Apex Court in Hindustan Petroleum (Supra), there was no need for issuance of notice. I am fortified in my view by both the decisions of the Apex Court in Hindustan Petroleum (Supra) and West Coast Paper Mills (Supra). Hence, this is not a case of over charge at all as the freight was paid as per the rates notified for certain distance. No other view can be taken in this matter. The in Hindustan Petroleum (Supra) will enure for the benefit of the appellant in this case also. In view of the above, the appeal is allowed. The respondents to calculate the difference within 12 weeks from today and pay the appellant.” (Emphasis supplied) 16. Accordingly, the High Court vide the aforesaid judgement & dated 23.02.2018 disposed of the lead appeal of FAO No. 843 of 2014, and thereafter by a batch of common s disposed of the other 75 appeals in terms of its findings recorded in the final judgement and passed in the lead appeal. 17.
