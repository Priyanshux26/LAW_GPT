which had been encashed; fourth, to security deposits with the service providers, amounting to Rs 56.8 Lakhs plus interest at 11% p.a. ; and that DMRC was entitled to Rs 46.04 Crores as Concession fee for the period from 23 February 2012 to 7 January 2013. 15. Assailing the award, DMRC instituted an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 199612 before the Delhi High Court. The Single-Judge of the High Court dismissed the petition13. This gave rise to an appeal under Section 37 before a Division Bench of the High Court. The appeal was partly allowed.14 16. Against the decision of the Division Bench of the High Court, DAMEPL moved a Special Leave Petition under Article 136 of the Constitution. A two-judge bench of this Court allowed the appeal, and restored the award. The review petition assailing this decision was dismissed. Thus, the curative petition. B. DMRC’s claim and the Tribunal’s findings 17. Before the Tribunal, DMRC claimed that – (i) it took steps to cure the defects immediately after it received the cure notice, including approaching SYSTRA -the original design consultant and convening meetings with the Ministry of Urban Development and that DAMEPL actively participated in all of these steps; (ii) that the real reason for the termination notice was that DAMPL had ceased to find the project financially viable. DMRC sought, inter alia, quashing of the 11 “Award” 12 “Arbitration Act”. 13 OMP (COMM) 307/2017 & OMP (I) (COMM) 200/2017 (‘Single Judge’) 14 FAO(OS)(COMM) 58/2018 & CM Nos. 13434/2018 (‘Division Bench’) 482 [2024] 4 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports termination notice; and a direction to the respondent to resume the performance of its obligations under the 2008 agreement. DAMEPL, on the other hand, claimed that there were defects attributable to DMRC’s faulty design; that these defects were not cured and no effective steps were taken to cure them within the 90-day cure period, resulting in material adverse effects to DAMEPL, entitling it to terminate the concession agreement. 18. The Tribunal was required to adjudicate on the validity of the termination notice. It framed the following issues: “Were there any defects in the civil structure of the airport metro line? If there were defects, did such defects have a material adverse effect on the performance of the obligation of DAMEPL under CA? If there were defects in the civil structure, which had a material adverse effect on the performance of the obligations under the CA by DAMEPL, have such defects been cured by DMRC and/or have any effective steps been taken within a period of 90 days from the date of notice by DAMEPL to cure the defects by DMRC and thus, were DMRC in breach of the CA as per 29.5.1 (i)?” 19. The Tribunal undertook an analysis of the defects in the structure and whether they had been cured or effective steps taken during the cure period. It noted that 72% of the girders were affected by cracks; the cause of the cracks was uncertain; the depth of the cracks was not reliably determined; and that the inspection for repairs carried out at the instance of DMRC was ‘non-serious’.
