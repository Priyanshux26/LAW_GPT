[Paras 13, 15, 17, 21, 23, 24] – Held: Per Dipankar Datta, J. (Dissenting) Allowing a convicted parliamentarian to attend parliamentary proceedings could not only be derogatory to the dignity of the Parliament but also derogatory to the good sense and wisdom of the people who elected such parliamentarian – While recognizing the importance of the electorate’s representation, it is necessary to maintain a balance between this right and the enforcement of legal accountability within the democratic framework – The fact that the court is approached by a parliamentarian/legislator, by itself, should not be viewed with such importance and indispensability – Thus, the passed by the High Court does not call for interference – Uttar Pradesh Gangsters and Anti Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986. [Paras 52, 80, 48] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 389(1) – Suspension of conviction – Essential parameters: Held: It is evident from the plain language of s. 389(1) that the appellate court is unambiguously vested with the power to issue an for the suspension of a sentence or an of conviction during the pendency of an appeal and grant bail to the incarcerated convict, for which it is imperative to assign the reasons in writing – The very notion of irreversible consequences is centered on factors, including the individual’s criminal antecedents, the gravity of the off ence, and its wider social impact, while simultaneously considering the facts and circumstances of the case – s. 389(1) should not be interpreted in a narrow manner, in the context of a stay on an of conviction, when there are irreversible consequences – An AFJAL ANSARI v. STATE OF UP 971 granting a stay of conviction should not be the rule but an exception and should be resorted to in rare cases depending upon the facts of a case – However, where conviction, if allowed to operate would lead to irreparable damage and where the convict cannot be compensated in any monetary terms or otherwise, if he is acquitted later on, that by itself carves out an exceptional situation. [Paras 10, 11, 15] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s. 389 (1) – Suspension of conviction – Conviction of an off ence involving ‘moral turpitude’, if a ground to deny suspension of conviction u/s. 389(1): Held: While invoking the concept of ‘moral turpitude’ as a decisive factor in granting or withholding the suspension of conviction for an individual, there is a resounding imperative to address the issue of depoliticising criminality – There has been increasing clamour to decriminalise polity and hold elected representatives accountable for their criminal antecedents - It is a hard truth that persons with a criminal background are potential threats to the very idea of democracy, since they often resort to criminal means to succeed in elections and other ventures – On facts, substantial doubt cast upon the appellant’s criminal antecedents along with the veracity and threat posed by these claims, in light of the many FIRs produced in the proceedings – Although ‘moral turpitude’ may carry relevance within the context of elected representatives, the courts are bound to construe the law in its extant state and confi ne their deliberations to those facets explicitly outlined, rather than delving into considerations pertaining to the moral rectitude or ethical character of actions – This is especially true when it is solely motivated by the convicted individual’s status as a political representative, with the aim of disqualifi cation.
