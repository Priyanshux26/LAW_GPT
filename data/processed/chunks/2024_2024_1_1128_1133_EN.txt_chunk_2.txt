This of the Magistrate was challenged by the tenants/complainants before the Sessions Judge. The Sessions Judge vide dated 23.03.2023, allowed the revision and directed that the complaint filed before the Magistrate under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. be forwarded to the concerned Police Station for registration and investigation. 6. The of the Revisional Court dated 23.03.2023 was challenged before the High Court by all the 13 accused through separate petitions titled under Section 482 Cr.P.C. and Article 227 of the Constitution of India. The High Court, while deciding these petitions, not only approved the of the Sessions Judge but also issued further directions regarding investigation, by the impugned dated 23.10.2023. It is this which is under challenge before us by way of these six petitions. Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 15433 of 2023 and Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 15294 of 2023 have been filed by the brother of the deceased with respect to the two complaints made by the two tenants. Special Leave Petition (Crl.) Nos. 14734-14735 of 2023 have been filed by the five purchasers under the sale deed dated 27.10.2021 again with respect to the two complaints filed by the two tenants. Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 14585 of 2023 and Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 14572 of 2023 have been filed by the six police personnel again arising out of the two complaints filed by the two tenants. 7. During the pendency of the petitions, it appears that some settlement has been arrived at between the complainants and the 13 accused. The subsequent purchasers have paid an amount of Rs. 10 lacs to each of the tenants, and in lieu thereof, the tenants have filed their affidavits stating that they do not wish to further prosecute their complaint. The details of the bank drafts have also been mentioned 1132 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports in the affidavits filed by the tenants along with Criminal Miscellaneous Petition No. 8150 of 2024 in Special Leave Petition (Crl.) Nos. 14734- 14735 of 2023. Based on this settlement, it is prayed that these petitions may be allowed, and the proceedings arising out of the two criminal complaints under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. be quashed. 8. From the factual matrix as recorded above, we find that the continuance of these two criminal proceedings would not be of any avail once the complainant has himself stated to withdraw the complaint. Their losses having been compensated, any further investigation or trial would be an exercise in futility. 9. The compensation for the tenants has been given by the subsequent purchasers, as stated in the affidavits, apparently for the reason that they are now the owners of the property and they have been instrumental in carrying out the demolition illegally. The widow of the deceased (although not a party before us) and the brother may not be having any further interest inasmuch as the property had already been sold by the deceased four and half months prior to his death. However, what we are not satisfied with is why the police personnel have been allowed to go scot-free in a case where they had an apparent roll in conspiring and in abetting the crime of the illegal detention of the tenants, coercing them to sign the document against their will, and getting the premises in question demolished without any from a competent Court.
