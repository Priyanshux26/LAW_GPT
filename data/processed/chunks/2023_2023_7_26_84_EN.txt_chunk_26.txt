Pertinently, this has already been noticed by this Court in its dated 27.07.2022.28 Further, the previous Judicial Pay Commissions had also recommended revision of pay with effect from 01.01.1996 and 01.01.2006 respectively. No objection can therefore be made regarding the application of the pay F structure from 01.01.2016. This recommendation thus merits acceptance. Thus, it is directed that the benefits of the recommendations as regards pay be given effect to with effect from 01.01.2016. VII. Status of Compliance of Directions in dated 27.07.2022 (Modification of Recommendation No.44.13) G 61. While the Commission suggested that the arrears of pay be given during the calendar year 2020, this Court after considering the submissions of the Union and the State that the payment of arrears at 28 dated 27.07.2022 in WP(C) No.643/2015 at Para 21. H 64 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A one go may not be possible and by dated 27.07.2022 directed that the payments be made in three separate installments. As per this as well, the final installment was payable by 30.06.2023. States had already sought extension of time to complete payments in the first two instalments. Considering the grievances of the States, by dated 18.01.2023, this Court directed: B “All the States/Union Territories which have made payment of only the first installment or the first two installments and the States and Union Territories which have come up with applications for extension of time, are permitted to make payment of arrears, at least within the time indicated in this C . The States and Union Territories which have not yet made payment of the first installment, shall make payment of the first installment by 31.03.2023. These States and Union Territories, as well as those who have already made payment of the first installment, shall make payment of the second D installment by 30.04.2023. The third and final installment shall be made by 30.06.2023.” VIII. DA on basis of Rates fixed by Central Government (Recommendation 44.14) 62. The recommendation of the SNJPC is that Dearness E Allowance may be paid at the rate fixed by the Central Government. It may be noted that the Commission has found that the rates fixed by the Central Government are normally accepted by the State across the country. The purpose of dearness allowance, as explained by this Court in Bengal Chemical & Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. v. Its Workmen (1969) 2 SCR 113, is “to neutralise a portion of the increase in the F cost of living.” When the rates which are fixed by the Central Government are followed by most of the States, the recommendation of the SNJPC is reasonable. This recommendation is also in the interests of uniformity of service conditions of judicial officers across the country, which, as stated above, is a cardinal principle on the basis of which the G present proceedings are based. Notably, a fixed rate of Dearness Allowance would also ensure that there is no lag in the accrual of the dearness allowance to the judicial officers. 63.
