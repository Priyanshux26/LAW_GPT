It will be appreciated that it is not always possible in all situations to give a logical and complete effect to a finding.” 1234 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 26. Again in Union of India v. Mohd. Ramzan Khan [(1991) 1 SCC 588 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 612 : (1991) 16 ATC 505] it was held that non-furnishing of a copy of the enquiry report to an employee amounted to violation of the principles of natural justice and any disciplinary action taken without furnishing such report was liable to be set aside. However, it was made clear that the decision would have prospective application so that no punishment already imposed would be open to challenge on this count. (See also Managing Director, ECIL v. B. Karunakar [(1993) 4 SCC 727 : 1993 SCC (L&S) 1184 : (1993) 25 ATC 704] .) 27. In the ultimate analysis, prospective overruling, despite the terminology, is only a recognition of the principle that the court moulds the reliefs claimed to meet the justice of the case — justice not in its logical but in its equitable sense. As far as this country is concerned, the power has been expressly conferred by Article 142 of the Constitution which allows this Court to “pass such decree or make such as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it”. In exercise of this power, this Court has often denied the relief claimed despite holding in the claimants’ favour in to do “complete justice”. 28. Given this constitutional discretion, it was perhaps unnecessary to resort to any principle of prospective overruling, a view which was expressed in Narayanibai v. State of Maharashtra [(1969) 3 SCC 468] at p. 470 and in Ashok Kumar Gupta v. State of U.P. [(1997) 5 SCC 201 : 1997 SCC (L&S) 1299] In the latter case, while dealing with the “doctrine of prospective overruling”, this Court said that it was a method evolved by the courts to adjust competing rights of parties so as to save transactions “whether statutory or otherwise, that were effected by the earlier law”. According to this Court, it was a rule “…of judicial craftsmanship with pragmatism and judicial statesmanship as a useful outline to bring about smooth transition of the operation of law [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1235 In Re : Section 6A of The Citizenship Act 1955 without unduly affecting the rights of the people who acted upon the law operated prior to the date of the overruling the previous law”. Ultimately, it is a question of this Court’s discretion and is, for this reason, relatable directly to the words of the Court granting the relief. xxx xxx xxx 32. The doctrine of prospective overruling was applied in Belsund Sugar Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar [(1999) 9 SCC 620] . The question which arose for consideration there was whether market fee could be levied under the Bihar Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1960 in respect to transactions of purchase of sugarcane, sugar and molasses by sugar mills.
