Bafna Motors (Mumbai) Private Limited and Others2 and South Indian Bank Limited and Others v. Naveen Mathew Philip and Another3. 7. Shri Basant further submitted that the conduct of the Borrower also disentitled him to an equitable relief. It is submitted that the Borrower had filed the writ petition after the entire payment was made by the appellant-auction purchaser and a Sale Certificate was also issued in its favour. The learned Senior Counsel therefore submitted that the writ petition filed by the Borrower deserves to be dismissed and the present appeal deserves to be allowed. 8. Shri Partha Sil, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the UCO Bank, also advanced similar arguments and prayed for dismissal of the writ petition filed by the Borrower. 9.

Digital Supreme Court Reports It is also not in dispute that on 14th December 2017, the learned DRT, though refused to interfere with the sale but directed the Respondent-Bank not to confirm the sale of the scheduled properties subject to the Borrower depositing 30% of the outstanding dues in two equal installments within one week and two weeks thereafter respectively. The learned DRT had also directed that, in case of failure of compliance, the interim stay would stand automatically vacated and the Respondent-Bank would be entitled to confirm the sale. It is also not in dispute that the Borrower did not comply with the said of the learned DRT.

After the aforesaid period was over, the appellant-auction purchaser deposited the balance amount of Rs.4,29,16,650/-.
