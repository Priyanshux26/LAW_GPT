The fi ner connotations and nuances of the language used in Section 19 of the Act of 2002, to the extent left uncharted by this Court in Vijay Madanlal Choudhray (supra), were still open to interpretation and resolution and, therefore, the High Court would have been well within its right to undertake that exercise. Be that as it may. 1 2022 (10) SCALE 577 724 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. 11. Saket Singh, IRS, Deputy Director, Directorate of Enforcement, Gurugram Zonal Offi ce, Rajokri, New Delhi, deposed to the replies fi led by the ED before this Court. Therein, he acknowledged that the second ECIR was recorded on 13.06.2023 based on FIR No. 0006 dated 17.04.2023. He stated that the name of Pankaj Bansal and the owners of M3M Group specifi cally found mention in the said FIR. However, perusal of the FIR refl ects that the name of Pankaj Bansal is not mentioned. Reference to ‘the owners of M3M Group’ was in the context of Roop Bansal and his brother, Basant Bansal, and not in a generic sense, as is now sought to be made out so as to rope in Pankaj Bansal also. Saket Singh further stated that though M3M Group, Pankaj Bansal and Basant Bansal were not named in the connected FIRs of the fi rst ECIR, investigation therein had shown that the promoters of M3M Group were also involved in money laundering. According to him, Basant Bansal refused to accept the summons issued on 13.06.2023 in relation to the second ECIR and did not give any information relating thereto. Manual summons dated 14.06.2023 were stated to have been issued to Pankaj Bansal on 14.06.2023 for his personal appearance and for recording of his statement before the ED’s Investigating Offi cer on the same day. He alleged that Pankaj Bansal accepted the summons but remained evasive in providing relevant information to the ED. He justifi ed the issuance of summons on an immediate basis, by claiming that it was a necessity as the promoters/key persons of M3M Group, including Pankaj Bansal and Basant Bansal, had been deliberately avoiding investigation in the fi rst ECIR as well and were not complying with the previously issued summons on multiple occasions. He alleged that Pankaj Bansal failed to comply with the summons in respect of the fi rst ECIR on multiple occasions, i.e., with the summons dated 04.06.2023, 06.06.2023 and 07.06.2023. Again, this statement is factually incorrect as these summonses were issued to Basant Bansal and not to Pankaj Bansal. 12. Saket Singh then went on to state that when Pankaj Bansal came to the ED’s offi ce on 14.06.2023, the Investigating Offi cer of the second ECIR served a summons upon him and as the Investigating Offi cer had evidence to show that Pankaj Bansal was guilty of the off ence of money laundering, he arrested him after following the due procedure prescribed under the Act of 2002 and the rules framed thereunder. He asserted that the arrests were made in accordance with Section 19 of the Act of 2002 and the information/ PANKAJ BANSAL v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS.
