In fact, the law laid down by this Court as discussed herein above is, where there is absence of any rule or absence of any prescription, the last day for fulfi lling the eligibility is the last date of submission of the application. This is a judicially recognized default date. In this case the last date for fi ling of the application has been prescribed as the cut-off in the Rules and we see absolutely no case for violation of Article 14. 62. In view of the above, we are not examining the other argument raised by Mr. Kaushik that the petitioners should be estopped from challenging since they have participated in the selection. Writ Petition (C) Nos. 705 of 2023 and 764 of 2023: 63. In these two Writ Petitions, the legal question involved is identical, except that the factual scenario in which they arise is slightly diff erent from that in Writ Petition (C) No. 724 of 2023. W.P. (C) No. 705/2023: 64. The petitioners call in question the communication dated 24.05.2023 issued by the UPSC to Petitioner No.1 - Vimlok Tiwari and Petitioner No.2 Ashwani Dubey and communication dated 30.05.2023 issued to Petitioner No.3 - Kuber Suraj Laxman. By the said communications, the UPSC converted the consideration of their candidature to the “General Category” since, according to the UPSC, the I&AC uploaded with their DAF-I mentions the Financial Year wrongly as 2021-2022 instead of 2020-2021. In the communication dated 30.05.2023 issued to Kuber Suraj 74 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. Laxman, it was mentioned that he had submitted the eligibility Certifi cate for EWS instead of I&AC. Each of these candidates have their own explanation.Petitioner No.1 Vimlok Tiwari states that, on 30.01.2023, a communication was received from the UPSC stating that discrepancy was found in the DAF-I submitted,inasmuch as the designation, stamp, seal of the issuing authority and F.Y. 2020-2021 has not been mentioned in the EWS Certifi cate submitted by him. He was requested to makeup the defi ciencies and to submit the original EWS Certifi cate with designation, stamp and seal of the issuing authority with the mention of the F.Y. 2020- 2021, be produced on the date of the Personality Test. According to the petitioner, he obtained the clarifi cation dated 31.03.2023 from the authority which issued the I&AC correcting the Financial Year to 2020-2021 and by a letter of 05.04.2023 submitted the clarifi cation. The Personality Test had already been held on 15.02.2023. He also submits that the designation, stamp, seal of the issuing authority was already available in the Certifi cate originally produced. 65. Insofar as Petition No.2 – Ashwani Dubey is concerned, according to the petitioner, he was in possession of the I&AC dated 25.01.2022 which mentioned the Financial Year as 2021-2022. He received an intimation dated 10.01.2023 advising him to makeup the defi ciencies and was requested to produce original EWS Certifi cate for the F.Y. 2020-2021 in the prescribed format issued on or before the cut-off date i.e.22.02.2022, on the date of the Personality Test.
