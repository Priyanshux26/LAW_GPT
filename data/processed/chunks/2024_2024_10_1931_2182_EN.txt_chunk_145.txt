13.2.4 Therefore, there was a reluctance to enter upon an examination of the mutually competing claims of Entry 52 - List I and Entry 24 - List II — Entries which deal with “industries”. Consequently, the appeals were dismissed. [2024] 10 S.C.R. 2131 State of U.P. & Ors. v. M/s Lalta Prasad Vaish and sons 13.3 When the expression “subject to” is used in an Entry in List II it would imply that the said Entry is subordinate to the respective Entries in List I and has to be read along with the relevant Entry in List I. Thus, on a conjoint reading of Entry 24 – List II with Entry 52 – List I, it is apparent that Entry 24 – List II is subject to Entry 52 – List I. The expression “subject to” in the Entries in List II has been a subject matter of interpretation in several decisions and is of legal import. 13.3.1 As per Black’s Law Dictionary, 5th Edition, Pg.1278, “subject to” means “liable, subordinate, subservient, inferior, obedient to, governed or affected by.” 13.3.2 The relevant s of this Court on the point are discussed as under: a) In Hingir Rampur Coal Company vs. State of Orissa (1961) 2 SCR 537 (“Hingir Rampur”), while interpreting the import of the expression “subject to” in Entry 23 – List II and the interplay of that Entry with Entry 54 – List I, this Court observed as undisputed the position in law that, once a Central Act containing a declaration by Parliament covering the field is passed as required by Entry 54 – List I, the State Legislature had no legislative competence to enact a legislation on the subject that has already been occupied by a Central legislation – not for reason of repugnancy but rather competence at the very inception. b) In Gujarat University vs. Shri Krishna Ranganath Mudholkar, AIR 1963 SC 703 (“Shri Krishna”), this Court was tasked with interpreting Entry 11 - List II, which, although stands omitted now, earlier read as ‘Education including universities, subject to the provisions of Entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I and Entry 25 of List III’. Therein, it was held that use of the expression “subject to” in Entry 11 - List II clearly indicated that legislation in respect of excluded matters cannot be made by the State Legislature. By the Constitution (Forty-Second Amendment), 1976, Entry 11 – List II was omitted, as noted 2132 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports above, and Entry 25 – List III was substituted as, ‘Education, including technical education, medical education and universities, subject to the provisions of Entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I; vocational and technical training of labour.’ In this context, this Court in Baharul Islam vs. The Indian Medical Association, 2023 SCC OnLine SC 79 (“Baharul Islam”), while referring to Modern Dental College & Research Centre vs. State of Madhya Pradesh (2016) 7 SCC 353 (“Modern Dental College”), explained that where one Entry is made ‘subject to’ another Entry, it means that out of the scope of the former Entry a field of legislation covered by the latter Entry has been reserved to be specially dealt with by the appropriate Legislature.
