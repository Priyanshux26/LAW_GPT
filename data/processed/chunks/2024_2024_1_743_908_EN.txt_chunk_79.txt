Pursuant to the in Sangeet, the Government of India vide its communication dated 01.02.2013 made to all the Home Secretaries of the States and Union Territories, stated that there is a need to relook at the manner in which remissions of sentence are made with reference to Section 432 read with Section 433-A of the CrPC and hence requested that there should be scrupulous compliance of the aforesaid provisions and not to grant remission in a wholesale manner. Thereafter, on 08.05.2013, the Home Department, Government of Gujarat issued a Circular referring to the decision of this Court dated 20.11.2012 in Sangeet and in to implement the same and also taking note of the communication of the Government of India dated 01.02.2013, the Circular dated 09.07.1992 was cancelled in following manner: “… Therefore, the provisions of circular No.JLK/3390/ CM/16/part/2/J dated 09.07.1992 of the Home Department hereinabove referred to in Srl. No.1, hereby stand cancelled.” Thereafter, on 23.01.2014, the State Government constituted a Committee headed by the Additional Chief Secretary (Home) for considering the policy and guidelines to be followed for the purpose of remission and pre-mature release of the prisoners. After careful consideration, the State Government issued guidelines/policy for consideration of cases of remission and premature release of the prisoners. In the said policy, it was categorically mentioned that “the prisoners who are convicted for 858 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the crimes” as mentioned in Annexure-I, shall not be considered for remission. Annexure-I contained the classes of prisoners who shall not be granted state remission as well as for premature release. Clause IV (a) and (d) read as follows: (a) A prisoner or prisoners sentenced for group murder of two or more persons. x x x (d) Prisoners convicted for murder with rape or gang rape. (xv) Realising that respondent Nos.3 to 13 would not be released under the Remission Policy dated 23.01.2014, which had substituted the earlier Policy dated 09.07.1992, which had been cancelled, the writ petition was filed by respondent No.3 herein before this Court seeking a specific direction to the State of Gujarat to consider his case as per the Policy dated 09.07.1992 which had by then been cancelled and substituted by another Policy dated 23.01.2014. (xvi) What is the effect of cancellation of the said policy by the State of Gujarat in light of the judgement of this Court in Sangeet and the communication of Union of India issued to each of the states including the State of Gujarat? Does it mean that the said policy of 09.07.1992 had stood cancelled and therefore got effaced and erased from the statute book and substituted by a new policy of 2014 which had to be considered. There was no pleading or discussion to that effect. 36.5. Thus, by suppressing material aspects and by misleading this Court, a direction was sought and issued to the respondent State of Gujarat to consider the premature release or remission of the writ petitioner, i.e., respondent No.3 on the basis of the policy dated 09.07.1992.
