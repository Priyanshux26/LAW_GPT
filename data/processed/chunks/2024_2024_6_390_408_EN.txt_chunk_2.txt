4. In substance, the main ground for review of the is that the Constitution Bench of this Court in Pankajakshi (supra) have uphold the validity of Section 41 of Punjab Courts Act, 19183, overruling this Court’s earlier in case of Kulwant Kaur & Ors. v. Gurdial Singh Maan (Dead) By Lrs. & Ors.4 holding that since Section 97(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976 has no application to Section 41 of the Punjab Act, therefore, Section 41 of the Punjab Act would necessarily continue as a law in force and the second appeal before the High Court has to be heard within the parameters of Section 41 of the Punjab Act, and not under Section 100 CPC. 5. Shri P.S. Patwalia, learned Senior counsel appearing for the petitioner would also refer to the subsequent s of this Court in Randhir Kaur v. Prithvi Pal Singh & Ors.5 and Gurbachan Sing (Dead) Through Lrs. v. Gurcharan Singh (Dead) Through Lrs. & Ors.6 wherein this Court relying upon Pankajakshi (supra) held that the scope of interference within the jurisdiction of the Punjab and Haryana High Court would be the same as under Section 100 of CPC as it existed prior to the 1976 amendment. The provisions of Section 41 of the Punjab Act and of Section 100 CPC, before its amendment in 1976, are in pari materia. Therefore, the questions of law are not required to be framed in second appeal before Punjab and Haryana High Court whose jurisdiction in second appeal is circumscribed by provision of Section 41 of the Punjab Act. 6. Shri Patwalia would submit that this Court has set aside the of High Court terming it as beyond the power under Section 100 2 [2016] 3 SCR 1018 : (2016) 6 SCC 157 3 ‘Punjab Act’ 4 [2001] 2 SCR 525 : (2001) 4 SCC 262 5 [2019] 9 SCR 776 : (2019) 17 SCC 71 6 (2023) SCC Online SC 875 394 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports CPC which is not legally correct, in view of the law laid down in Pankajakshi (supra). It is further argued that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the petitioner was entitled to succeed to the property by way of natural succession and the finding of the High Court that the Will relied upon by the respondents has not been proved as it is surrounded by suspicious circumstances ought not to have been interfered by this Court. It is argued that a finding of fact erroneously or perversely recorded by the First Appellate Court can always be interfered by the High Court. Hence, there is no infirmity in the rendered by the High Court and the same ought not to have been interfered by this Court while deciding the Civil Appeal No. 6567 of 2014 on an erroneous ground that the High Court has travelled beyond its jurisdiction and power under Section 100 CPC as it stands of the 1976 amendment. 7. Shri Manoj Swarup, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents would not dispute the legal position as has been settled by this Court in the matter of Pankajakshi (supra).
