The High Court should have looked into the documents such as possession receipts, payment receipts and extracts of bank ledger statements, in respect of the subject sales produced before the High Court. The High Court erred in holding that no material had been placed to establish or demonstrate that the property had in fact been sold in the year 2012 itself. The High Court erred in holding in para 35that an imaginary plea had been made by way of a defence that cash transaction took place for sale in the year 2012 wherein no date is mentioned. (ii) The High Court erred in holding that the documents as above were purportedly concocted and that only the income tax returns could be the best evidence. (iii) The High Court overlooked the fact that the impugned sale transactions were only of 1521 sq.mtrs. of survey no. 63 admeasuring 33,790 sq.mtrs. and that the survey no. 65 admeasuring 31,095 sq.mtrs. was unsold and vacant which clearly refl ected adherence to the statement as understood by the Appellants and supported the explanation of the Appellants that the subject sales of small plots of 118 sq.mtrs. each had to be formally concluded since the actual transfers had taken place many years prior to 14.10.2015 and the allottees were being seriously prejudiced in development of the plots and such transfers were never BALWANTBHAI SOMABHAI BHANDARI v. HIRALAL 1087 SOMABHAI CONTRACTOR (DECEASED) REP. BY LRS. & ORS. [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] intended to be covered under the statement of 14.10.2015 which would operate only for future transfers. (iv) The High Court erred in overlooking that the standard of proof required in a contempt proceeding, being a quasi- criminal proceeding, is that of a criminal proceeding and the breach has to be established beyond reasonable doubt. The facts of the present case do not establish beyond reasonable doubt that there was a wilful breach or disobedience of an of the court, or statement or undertaking given to the court. The power of contempt should be exercised cautiously and only after the required standard of proof is met. (v) The High Court erred in proceeding on the basis that the Appellants continued to commit contempt and in that regard relying on the transactions stated at Serial Nos.12 and 13 respectively of the table at para 26 of the impugned judgement. The said transaction at Serial No.12 purportedly of 30.10.2018, of a shop, is not a part of the subject lands S.No.63 and 65 with regard to which dated 14.10.2015 was passed; and the transaction at Serial No.13 is of 25.7.2017, hence it is not of a date after the fi ling of the contempt petition (fi led on 12.01.2018). (d) The High Court has erred in overlooking the context and background facts in which the statement was made and what was meant and covered in the statement in light of the same. (e) The Court has overlooked the requirement of section 13 of the Act 1971 since the conduct of the Appellant has not obstructed the cause of justice in any manner whatsoever.
