28.2. In other words, the s passed by this Court on 23.03.2020, 06.05.2020, 10.07.2020, 27.04.2021 and 23.09.2021 in SMWP No. 3 of 2020 leave nothing to doubt that special and extraordinary measures were provided by this Court for advancing the cause of justice in the wake of challenges thrown by the pandemic; and their applicability cannot be denied in relation to the period prescribed for fi ling the written statement. It would be unrealistic and illogical to assume that while this Court has provided for exclusion of period for institution 808 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. of the suit and therefore, a suit otherwise fi led beyond limitation (if the limitation had expired between 15.03.2020 to 02.10.2021) could still be fi led within 90 days from 03.10.2021 but the period for fi ling written statement, if expired during that period, has to operate against the defendant. 33.4 Having regard to the s subsequently passed by the three- Judge Bench of this Court in SMWP No. 3 of 2020 (and MA No. 665 of 2021 therein), as also having regard to the fundamental diff erence of facts and the surrounding factors, the said decision in Sagufa Ahmed, in our view, is also of no application to the present case.” According to the learned Senior Counsel, the above paragraphs squarely cover his case, since the extended period expired on 06.06.2020. 7. Mr. Sahil Tagotra, learned Counsel for the plaintiff reiterated the fi ndings of the High Court and submitted that the applicants have forfeited their right to fi le the written statements. 8. In the above background, the only question that arises for consideration is, was the High Court justifi ed in rejecting the application for extension of time dated 20.01.2021 and in not taking the written statements on record? Discussion and Conclusion: 9. “Vigilantibus non dormientibus jura subveniunt” - the law assists those who are vigilant, not those who sleep over their rights is a fundamental legal maxim on which statutes of limitations are premised. 10. When the whole world was in the grip of devastating pandemic, it could never have been said that the parties were sleeping over their rights. It is, at this juncture, that this Court stepped in and after taking suo motu cognizance passed s under Article 142 of the Constitution of India extending the deadlines. The extraordinary situation was dealt with rightly by extraordinary s protecting the rights of parties by ensuring that their remedies and defences were not barred. 11. In suo motu proceedings titled In Re: Cognizance for Extension of Limitation, series of s came to be passed. Those s are dated 23.03.2020, 06.05.2020, 10.07.2020, 08.03.2021, 27.04.2021 and ADITYA KHAITAN & ORS. v. IL AND FS FINANCIAL 809 SERVICES LIMITED [K. V. VISWANATHAN, J.] 23.09.2021. The s are not repeated since the relevant portions are extracted in Prakash Corporates (supra). 12. However, the s of 23.03.2020 and 08.03.2021 are extracted herein below to show the contrast between the s that obtained when Sagufa Ahmed (supra) was pronounced and the s passed post- Sagufa Ahmed (supra).
