SUBMISSIONS 6. Mr Nakul Divan, the learned senior counsel appearing for the first appellant, pointed out that the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in her dated 13th January 2023 in the case of Kothari Developers v. Madhukant S Patel2 held that the Arbitral Tribunal was entitled to invoke its power under Section 32(2)(c) of the Arbitration Act if it is proved that the proceedings have become unnecessary due to the claimant’s inaction. He submitted 1 2012 SCC OnLine Cal 10496 2 Arbitration Petition (L) No.29362 of 2022 [2024] 6 S.C.R. 767 Dani Wooltex Corporation & Ors. v. Sheil Properties Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. that Section 14 of the Arbitration Act does not empower the Court to second-guess the Arbitral Tribunal, especially when the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal is based on the appreciation of facts and a plausible view has been taken. The learned senior counsel further pointed out that the Arbitral Tribunal attempted to ensure Sheil’s participation in Marico’s arbitration. After the award in the case of Marico, Sheil declined to attend the meeting held on 11th March 2020 by the Arbitral Tribunal. It is submitted that there is nothing on record to indicate that the arbitration based on Sheil’s claim was to proceed after Marico’s arbitration, and there is no material placed on record to that effect. He submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal had rendered a finding of fact on the stand taken by Sheil, which cannot be disturbed by the Court. He submitted that Sheil’s plea that it was awaiting the decision in the Marico arbitration could not be accepted as the Arbitral Tribunal never indicated that the arbitration based on Sheil’s claim would proceed only after the Marico arbitration was over. He submitted that Sheil took no interest in moving the Arbitral Tribunal for a long time since 2012. He submitted that the word “unnecessary” used in Section 32(2)(c) of the Arbitration Act will have to be widely or liberally interpreted. 7. Mr Shekhar Naphade, the learned senior counsel appearing for Sheil, contended that without recording a positive finding that it is either unnecessary or impossible to continue the proceedings, the power under Section 32(2)(c) of the Arbitration Act cannot be exercised. Relying upon the decision on this Court in the case of Lalitkumar V Sanghavi & Anr. v. Dharamdas V Sanghavi & Ors.3, the learned senior counsel submitted that the Court, while exercising the power under Section 14(2) of the Arbitration Act, is required to go into the issue of the legality of the termination of mandate by the Arbitral Tribunal. He submitted that the abandonment cannot be inferred. He relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of Godrej and Boyce Manufacturing Company Limited v. Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai & Ors4. He submitted that suits filed by Marico and Sheil were separate suits, and, therefore, arbitral proceedings were also separate. Marico and Sheil had not sought any relief 3 [2014] 3 SCR 558 : (2014) 7 SCC 255 4 [2023] 6 SCR 56 : 2023 SCC Online 592 768 [2024] 6 S.C.R.
