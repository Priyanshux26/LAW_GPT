records that the main objective of this law was to comprehensively cover international and commercial arbitration and conciliation as also domestic arbitration and conciliation. b. Section 5 of the Arbitration Act 174. In the above segments, we have dealt with the scope of Section 5 of the Arbitration Act. It restricts the extent of judicial intervention in various matters governed by Part I of the Arbitration Act.163 The non- obstante clause in this provision is of particular signifi cance. It indicates that the rule in Section 5 (and consequently, the provisions of the Arbitration Act) must take precedence over any other law for the time being in force. Any intervention by the courts (including impounding an agreement in which an arbitration clause is contained) is, therefore, permitted only if the Arbitration Act provides for such a step, which it does not. Sections 33 and 35 cannot be allowed to operate in proceedings under Section 11 (or Section 8 as the case may be), in view of the non-obstante clause in Section 5. This being the case, we are unable to agree with the decision in N N Global 2 (supra), that the court in a proceeding under section 11 must give eff ect to Sections 33 and 35 of the Stamp Act despite the interdict in Section 5. The court held: “129. Section 5 no doubt provides for a non obstante clause. It provides against judicial interference except as provided in the Act. The non obstante clause purports to proclaim so despite the presence of any law which may provide for interference otherwise. However, this does not mean that the operation of the Stamp Act, in particular, Sections 33 and 35 would not have any play. We are of the clear view that the purport of Section 5 is not to take away the eff ect of Sections 33 and 35 of the Stamp Act. The Court under Section 11 purporting to give eff ect to Sections 33 and 35 cannot be accused of judicial interference contrary to Section 5 of the Act.” 163 CDC Financial Services (Mauritius) Ltd. v. BPL Communications Ltd., (2003) 12 SCC 140; Empire Jute Co. Ltd. v. Jute Corpn. of India Ltd., (2007) 14 SCC 680; Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49; Bhaven Construction v. Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd., (2022) 1 SCC 75 IN RE: INTERPLAY BETWEEN ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS UNDER 1175 THE ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT 1996 AND THE INDIAN STAMP ACT 1899 [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI ] 175. Section 5 is eff ectively rendered otiose by the interpretation given to it in N N Global 2 (supra). The court failed to provide a reason for holding that Section 5 of the Arbitration Act does not have the eff ect of excluding the operation of Sections 33 and 35 of the Stamp Act in proceedings under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act. The non-obstante clause in Section 5 does precisely this. In addition to the eff ect of the non-obstante clause, the Arbitration Act is a special law.
