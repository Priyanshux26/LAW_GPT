74. However, this Court in Tata Steel Ltd. v. Union of India, reported in (2015) 6 SCC 193 while examining Rule 64B of the erstwhile MCR, 1960 has observed that the aforesaid rules were general in nature and applicable to types of minerals including coal. This Court rejected the categorization of coal on a different pedestal from other minerals under the MMDR Act for the purpose of levy of royalty. The relevant observations read as under: - "70. There is nothing to indicate in Rule 64-B and Rule 64-C of the MCR that coal has been put on a different pedestal from other minerals mentioned in the MMDR Act read with the Second Schedule thereto. It is, therefore, difficult to accept the view canvassed by the Union of India that these Rules “may not be particularly applicable on coal minerals”. That apart, the stand of the Union of India is not definite or categorical (“may not be”). In any event, 102 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports we are not bound to accept the interpretation given by the Union of India to Rule 64-B and Rule 64-C of the MCR as excluding only coal. On the contrary, in NMDC [National Mineral Development Corpn. Ltd. v. State of M.P. (2004) 6 SCC 281] this Court has observed that these Rules are general in nature, applicable to all types of minerals, which includes coal. The expression of opinion by the Union of India is contrary to the observations of this Court. 71. Therefore, on a plain reading of Rule 64-B and Rule 64-C of the MCR, we are of the opinion that with effect from 25-9-2000 when these Rules were inserted in the MCR, royalty is payable on all minerals including coal at the stage mentioned in these Rules, that is, on removal of the mineral from the boundaries of the leased area. For the period prior to that, the law laid down in Central Coalfields Ltd. [Central Coalfields Ltd. v. State of Jharkhand, Civil Appeal No. 8395 of 2001 decided by three learned Judges on 24-9-2003. Ed. : Now reported at (2015) 6 SCC 220.] will operate, as far as coal is concerned, from 10-8-1998 when SAIL [State of Orissa v. SAIL (1998) 6 SCC 476] was decided, though for different reasons.” (Emphasis supplied) 75. Even the respondents herein appear to have acknowledged that the differing mechanism for computation of royalty for coal and other minerals is not based on any fine distinction between the two, but rather an anomaly in the MCR, 2016 and MCDR, 2017, which is why it constituted a committee to look into the same and has proposed amendments for rectifying the same. 76. In view of the fact that the appropriate authorities are actively considering the issue of compounding royalties in the computation of average sale price for all other minerals, and the fact that a notice for public consultation on amending the MMDR Act to inter-alia address the aforementioned issue, we may not say anything further as regards whether the Explanation(s) to Rule 38 of the MCR, 2016 and Rule 45 of the MCDR, 2017 are manifestly arbitrary or not.
