Union of India, (1970) 2 SCC 780 [40]. 22 KA Abbas (supra) [20,34] 23 [1971] 2 SCR 446 : (1970) 2 SCC 780 24 KA Abbas (supra) [34] [2024] 7 S.C.R. 263 Nipun Malhotra v. Sony Pictures Films India Private Limited & Ors. a hypersensitive person. Moreover, the Board must be alive to social change and must not adopt a conservative or orthodox approach. The limits on expression must be ‘necessary’, rather than merely expedient or convenient, which are relatively lower thresholds.25 The Board must make a “substantial allowance” in favour of freedom and allow creative works to interpret both the foibles as well as the good in the society.26 24. Since the Cinematograph Act provides for an elaborate procedure for certification of films by expert bodies, the approval of the statutory committees such as the Examination Committee must be given due weight. The Board has the benefit of hearing the perspective of the filmmakers, who make relevant representations before the Board. Courts are slow to interfere with the conclusions of specialised bodies, constituted under the Act.27 In this narrow scope of intervention, the Court may not act like a film critic and must observe certain grounding principles. For instance, the mere mention of a subject in the film is not problematic in itself and a deeper examination of the manner in which the theme has been handled is required.28 In Bobby Art International v. Om Pal Singh Hoon29, this Court held that as long as the overall message of the film is not to extol a social evil, its mere depiction of a social evil is not impermissible. It was held there that the portrayal of sexual violence could not be construed as a promotion of such violence.30 In Nachiketa Walhekar v. Central Board of Film Certification31, a three-judge bench speaking through one of us (Dr DY Chandrachud J) refused to stay the release of a film on the ground of its apprehended use as evidence in a pending trial. It was held that the Court will be extremely slow to restrain creative works, once the Board had approved exhibition.32 25. Restraints on films are founded on principles of due process, social interest, limited application in cases of absolute necessity and clear 25 S Rangarajan (supra) [21,53] 26 Ramesh v.

Digital Supreme Court Reports purpose of the restraint.33 Among the principles which must be borne in mind when deciding the fitness of a film for public exhibition include the following: (i) Social impact of the film is judged from the perspective of an ordinary person of reasonable intelligence and not a hypersensitive person; (iii) Social change, rather than orthodox notions or what is right and moral must be borne in mind; and (iv) The film must be judged by its overall message and not from isolated depictions of social evils.
