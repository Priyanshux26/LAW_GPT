On 28th January 2016, the MoP issued the revised Tariff Policy. As per clause 6.1 of the revised Tariff Policy, the Appropriate Commission was required to consider the cost of imported/market-based e-auction coal procured for making up the shortfall in the domestic coal for pass- B through in tariff of competitively bid projects. 21. Thereafter, on 9th March 2016, APML filed appeals before the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (hereinafter referred to as “APTEL”), being Appeal Nos. 129 of 2016 and 130 of 2016, challenging the s passed by the MERC in Case Nos.189 of 2013 and 140 of C 2014. MSEDCL too filed cross-appeals against the MERC s being Appeal Nos. 187 and 188 of 2016. 22. On 4th May 2017, the learned APTEL remanded the issues raised in the cross-appeals filed by APML and MSEDCL for fresh consideration by the MERC in the light of the of this Court in D the case of Energy Watchdog v. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and others1 which was decided on 11th April 2017. 23. By dated 7th March 2018, the MERC decided Case No.189 of 2013 and 140 of 2014, wherein, while allowing the claims of APML for relief on account of a Change in Law for 1180 MW capacity, E it restricted it to the extent of the minimum supply obligations specified for the CIL subsidiaries for the last four years of the 12th Five Year Plan period i.e. Financial Year 2013-14 to Financial Year 2016-17 as per the NCDP, 2013. It further held that the alternate coal quantity for meeting the domestic coal shortfall shall be computed based on the Station Heat Rate (“SHR” for short) mentioned by APML in the bid documents and F the middle value of the Gross Calorific Value (“GCV” for short) range of assured coal grade for domestic coal as per the FSA/LoA/MoU. 24. Being aggrieved thereby, APML preferred appeals before the learned APTEL. The learned APTEL framed the following three issues: G “Issue No. 1: Whether the MERC was correct in holding that the net SHR submitted by the Appellant in its bid or SHR and Auxiliary Consumption norms specified for new generating stations 1 (2017) 14 SCC 80 H 94 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A under the MYT Regulations, 2011, whichever is superior shall form the basis for computing Change in Law compensation under the PPAs? Issue No. 2: Whether the MERC was correct in holding B that the reference GCV of domestic coal supplied by CIL shall be the middle value of GCV range of assured coal grade in LoA/FSA/ MoU and not the GCV as received? Issue No. 3: Whether the MERC was correct in holding C that for the purpose of Change in Law compensation for 1180 MW capacity, shortfall in domestic linkage coal shall be assessed by considering the coal supply as the maximum of (1) actual quantum of coal offered for offtake by CIL under the LoA/FSA and (2) D the minimum assured quantum in NCDP 2013 for the respective year?” 25.
