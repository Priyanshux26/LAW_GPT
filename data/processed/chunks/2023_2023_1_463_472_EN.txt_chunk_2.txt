E The following Reasons were given by the Court: REASONS 1. The legal issue raised in the aforementioned writ petitions relates to the scope and ambit of judicial review in the matter of appointment of judges to the High Courts under Article 217 of the Constitution of India1. F 2. In our opinion, this legal issue is settled and is not res integra. 1 217. Appointment and conditions of the office of a Judge of a High Court.— (1) Every Judge of a High Court shall be appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and seal on the recommendation of the National Judicial Appointments Commission referred to in article 124A, and shall hold office, in the case of an additional or acting G Judge, as provided in article 224, and in any other case, until he attains the age of sixty- two years: Provided that— (a) a Judge may, by writing under his hand addressed to the President, resign his office; (b) a Judge may be removed from his office by the President in the manner provided in clause (4) of article 124 for the removal of a Judge of the Supreme Court; H ANNA MATHEWS AND OTHERS v. SUPREME COURT OF 467 INDIA AND OTHERS 3. This Court, in Mahesh Chandra Gupta v. Union of India A and Others2, has held that appointment of a judge is an executive function of the President of India. Article 217(1) prescribes the constitutional requirement of consultation. Fitness of a person to be appointed as a judge of the High Court is evaluated in the consultation process. Evaluation of the worth and merit of a person is a matter entirely different from B eligibility of a candidate for elevation. While Article 217(2) prescribes the threshold limit or the entry point for a person to be qualified to be a judge of a High Court, Article 217(1) prescribes the procedure to be followed, which procedure is designed to test the fitness of a person so to be appointed; her character, her integrity, her competence, her C knowledge and the like. Thus, this draws on the basic difference between eligibility and suitability. Eligibility is an objective factor which is determined by applying the parameters or qualifications specified in Article 217(2). Therefore, when eligibility is put in question, the question D (c) the office of a Judge shall be vacated by his being appointed by the President to be a Judge of the Supreme Court or by his being transferred by the President to any other High Court within the territory of India.
