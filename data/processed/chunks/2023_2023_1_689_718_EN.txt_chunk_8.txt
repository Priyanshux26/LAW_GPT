Even if {for the sake of argument} notice under section 158BC is not mandatory, that does not change the specific words of section 159BFA and E cannot bring within its net a person who has not been issued a notice under section 158BC. On the other hand, the argument being raised by the assessee ensures that post 2002 even the “other person” comes within the purview of section 158BFA. (iv) This argument of the Department also goes against the F specific pari materia provision namely section 153C. as rightly pointed out by the learned ASG, post 31st May, 2003, in case of a search, the provisions of 153A to 153C apply and that section 153C is pari materia with 158BD.” 6.6 Making above submissions, it is prayed to hold that in absence G of the notice under Section 158BC, served upon the assessee – “other person”, the Assessing Officer was not justified in levying the interest under Section 158BFA. 6.7 Now, so far as the levy of surcharge under proviso to Section 113 of Income Tax Act is concerned, it is vehemently submitted that as H 700 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A such the said question is now covered in favour of the assessee by the Constitution Bench decision of this Court in the case of Vatika Township Private Limited (supra) (Para 37 to 40). It is submitted that the decision of this Court in the case of Suresh N. Gupta (supra) that has been relied upon by the High Court in the impugned has been specifically overruled by the Constitution Bench in Vatika Township B Private Limited (supra). 6.8 Now, so far as chargeability of interest under Section 158BFA prior to 01.06.1999 in the case of persons issued notice under Section 158BC is concerned, it is submitted that interest only follows the principal. In this case the principal being the tax payable. It is submitted that in C other words the liability to pay interest cannot arise if there was no liability to pay the tax itself along with the return, at the relevant point of time. It is submitted that interest only being an element to compensate the revenue for having been deprived of the tax, interest can start running only once a liability to deposit tax arises. D 6.9 It is submitted that in the present case it is clear that neither Section 158BC nor Section 158BFA require the assessee to pay tax along with the return. It is submitted that this liability to deposit the tax along with return arises only under Section 140A. However, at the relevant point of time Section 140A did not apply to Section 158BC and hence E there was no liability to deposit tax along with the return. It is submitted that this lacuna was noticed by Parliament and by the Finance Act, 1999, the words “Section 158BC” have been inserted in Section 140A w.e.f. 01.06.1999. It is submitted that for the period prior to 01.06.1999 the submission on behalf of the department that Section 158BFA is to be seen independently from Section 140A may not be accepted.
