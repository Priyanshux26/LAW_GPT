Leave granted. 2. Tirth and prasad offered at places of worship are regarded as sacred and bond the worshiper with the worshipped. While in temples and gurudwaras, prasad or bhog may be an essential part of their religion, it is not uncommon for other places of worship to serve some food, toast or drink as a religious offering. 3. As of 2019, it is believed that India has a place of worship for every 400 people. While in most of these religious places, food is prepared and served at a large scale on special occasions, there are hundreds of temples and gurudwaras, which serve tens of thousands of devotees twice every day. Several temples and gurudwaras have their own unique and traditional way of preparing the prasad or bhog 366 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports like the Laddu of Tirupati and Karah Prasad of the Golden Temple at Amritsar1. Though somewhat connected with divine blessing in the form of prasad or bhog, this case draws us back to aggressive competing business interests - for supply of 7000 kilograms of cardamom for making Aravana Prasadam. 4. Travancore Devaswom Board is in appeal challenging the decision of the High Court of Kerala2 allowing the writ petition filed as a public interest litigation by respondent company in a contract by tender for sourcing raw material for preparation of Aravana Prasadam in the Sabarimala Temple.
