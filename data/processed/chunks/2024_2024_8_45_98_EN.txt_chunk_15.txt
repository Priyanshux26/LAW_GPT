The NTA has reported that the leak of the examination paper occurred between 8:02 am and 9:23 am on 5 May 2024. According to their submission, the accused gained unauthorized access by entering the strongroom at Oasis School through a rear door. Once inside, the individual accessed one of the trunks containing the examination materials. This trunk was part of the secure storage intended to safeguard the question papers before distribution. CCTV footage from the school shows him entering at 8:02 am and leaving at 9:23 am. It was also submitted that the accused opened the trunk from the rear so as not to break the seal, took the papers from the trunk, photographed them, resealed the envelope, and delivered the digital copies to the paper solvers by around 9:30 am. 37.

NTA issued a press release on 5 May 2024, acknowledging the issue of incorrect distribution of question papers, which resulted in a significant loss of time for the candidates at Girls Higher Secondary Model School, Mandir, Mantown, Sawai Madhopur, Rajasthan. However, during the course of arguments before us, it emerged that twelve centres initially received question papers from Canara Bank instead of SBI. Of these, four centres replaced the papers originating in Canara Bank with papers lodged in safe custody with SBI upon realizing the mistake. Consequently, in eight centres, candidates attempted the Canara Bank paper in full. As a result, approximately 3,307 candidates were assessed on their performance with respect to the Canara Bank papers instead of the SBI papers.
