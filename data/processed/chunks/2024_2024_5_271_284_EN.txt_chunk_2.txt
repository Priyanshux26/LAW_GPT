Further, respondent availed cenvat credit of the duty paid on those two goods at the time of clearance from Jammu. Respondent also imported cocoa butter and cocoa powder from China and Malaysia, receiving the same in its factory at Taloja. 5.2. The factory of the respondent at Taloja was visited by officials of the appellant and it was found that the respondent was only putting labels on the goods brought from Jammu as well as on the imported goods. As the labels were already fixed on the boxes containing the two goods, additional labels affixed by the respondent did not amount to manufacture since affixing of additional label did not enhance the marketability of the goods which were already marketable. 5.3. In such circumstances, appellant issued show cause cum demand notice dated 09.10.2012 to the respondent to show cause as to why the activity of labelling undertaken by the respondent on the product cocoa butter received from the Jammu unit and also on the imported goods should not be held as activities not amounting to manufacture in terms of Note 3 to Chapter 18 of the Central Excise Tariff Act. It was alleged that respondent had wrongly availed cenvat credit amounting to Rs. 23,02,53,752.00 for the period from June, 2008 to July, 2012 which should not be demanded and recovered under Rule 14 of the Cenvat Credit Rules read with Section 11A(1) of the Central Excise Act (since renumbered as Section 11A (4) of the Central Excise Act with effect from 08.04.2011). It was further alleged that rebate claims amounting to Rs. 13,22,30,368.00 for the period from June, 2008 to July, 2011, were erroneously sanctioned and utilised by the respondent which should not be demanded and recovered under Section 11A(1) of the Central [2024] 5 S.C.R. 275 Commissioner of Central Excise Belapur v. Jindal Drugs Ltd. Excise Act (since renumbered as Section 11A(4) of the Central Excise Act with effect from 08.04.2011). Respondent was also called upon to show cause as to why interest at the appropriate rate on the cenvat credit wrongly availed of and utilised as determined and demanded should not be recovered from it under the provisions of Rule 14 of the Cenvat Credit Rules, 2004 read with Section 11AB of the Central Excise Act (now Section 11AA of the said Act with effect from 08.04.2011). 5.4. Respondent submitted written reply dated 08.02.2013 denying all the allegations made in the show cause notice. 5.5. Following adjudication, the appellant vide the in original dated 25.02.2013 held that cocoa butter received by the respondent at its Taloja unit from its unit at Jammu as well as the imported cocoa butter were already packed in corrugated boxes of 25Kg each. The exported cocoa butter was also in corrugated boxes of 25Kg each. Hence no repackaging activity was undertaken either on the goods received from the Jammu unit or on the imported cocoa butter. Appellant further held that the goods received from the Jammu unit already contained a label. On receipt of the goods at Taloja, two more labels on two sides of the carton were affixed.
