D Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 – s.53(1)(a)-(f) – Waterfall mechanism – Priority of claims – of distribution of assets – “government dues” – Corporate debtor entered into an agreement with appellant-PVVNL for supply of electricity – PVVNL raised bills for supply of electricity to the corporate debtor but E dues remained unpaid – PVVNL attached the corporate debtor’s properties – The Tehsildar, restrained transfer of property by sale, donation or any other mode, and also created a charge on the properties – Corporate debtor underwent resolution process which was not successful and became subject to liquidation – District F Collector issued notice for recovery of outstanding dues – NCLT directed Tehsildar to immediately release property in favour of the liquidator of the corporate debtor for enabling its sale, and after realisation of its value, for distributing the proceeds in accordance with the IBC – Appeal rejected by NCLAT – PVVNL argued that rights of electricity suppliers like PVVNL were not subordinate and G subject to the ‘priority of claims’ mechanism under the IBC – Plea of the liquidator that dues owed to PVVNL were technically owed to the “government”, and thus occupied a lower position in the of priority of clearance – Held:”government dues” is not defined in the IBC – It finds place only in the preamble – However, what H 1221 1222 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A constitutes such dues is spelt out in the ‘waterfall mechanism’ u/ s.53(1)(e), which inter alia states that, “Any amount due to the Central Government and the State Government including the amount to be received on account of the Consolidated Fund of India and the Consolidated Fund of the State” ranks lower in priority to the class of creditors described in Clauses (a) to (d) of s.53(1) – There exists B a separate enumeration or specification of the Central Government and State Government dues, as a class apart from other creditors, including creditorswho may have secured interest (in respect of which amounts may be payable tothem) – These dues are distinct and have to be treated as separate from those owed to secured creditors – C Further, PVVNL undoubtedly has government participation however, that does not render it a government or a part of the ‘State Government’ – Its functions can be replicated by other entities, both private and public – Therefore, dues or amounts payable to PVVNL do not fall within the description of s.53(1)(f) – Uttar Pradesh Electricity Supply Code, 2005 – General Clauses Act, 1897 – ss.3(8), 3(60).
