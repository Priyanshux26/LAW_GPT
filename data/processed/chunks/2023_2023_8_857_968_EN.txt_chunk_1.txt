E Constitution of India – Art.153 – Position of Governor – In Internal Disputes of a Political Party – Split in Political Party – Held: The Governor is the titular head of the State Government – He is a constitutional functionary who derives his authority from the Constitution and he cannot exercise a power that is not conferred on him by the Constitution or a law made under it – Neither the F Constitution nor the laws enacted by Parliament provide for a mechanism by which disputes amongst members of a particular political party can be settled – They certainly do not empower the Governor to enter the political arena and play a role (however minute) either in inter-party disputes or in intra-party disputes. G Constitution of India: Tenth Schedule and Arts.32 & 226 – Power and Jurisdiction of Court – To adjudicate upon Disqualifications of Legislative Members – Held: Disqualification of a person for being a member of the House has drastic consequences for the member concerned and by extension, for the H citizens of that constituency – Supreme Court should normally refrain SUBHASH DESAI v. PRINCIPAL SECRETARY, GOVERNOR OF 859 MAHARASHTRA from deciding disqualification petitions at the first instance, having A due regard to constitutional intendment – The question of disqualification ought to be adjudicated by the constitutional authority concerned, namely the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, by following the procedure prescribed – The Speaker must decide disqualification petitions within a reasonable period. B Constitution of India: Art.181 – Reference to Larger Bench – Whether a notice for removal of a Speaker restricts them from continuing with disqualification proceedings under Tenth Schedule as held by this Court in Nabam Rebia – Held: Although the decision in Nabam Rebia is not applicable to the factual scenario, however, C Nabam Rebia is in conflict with the judgement in Kihoto Hollohan – It appears that the majority in Nabam Rebia did not consider the effect and import of Article 181 of Constitution of India – Hence, the decision in Nabam Rebia merits reference to a larger Bench because a substantial question of law remains to be settled. Constitution of India: Tenth Schedule – Maharashtra D Legislative Members (Removal of Disqualification) Act, 1956 – s.23 – Maharashtra Legislative Assembly (Disqualification on Ground of Defection) Rules 1986 – Rule 3(1)(a) & 6 – Appointment of Whip – Difference between Political Party and Legislature Party – Held: The political party and not the legislature party appoints the Whip E and the Leader – The Tenth Schedule would become unworkable if the term ‘political party’ is read as the ‘legislature party’ – A clear demarcation is made between political party and legislature party for the purpose of a merger under Paragraph 4 – To read the term ‘political party’ as ‘legislature party’ would be contrary to the plain language of the Tenth Schedule – Direction to vote in a particular F manner or to abstain from voting is issued by the political party and not the legislature party – The Speaker must recognize the Whip and the Leader who are duly authorised by the political party after conducting an enquiry in this regard.
