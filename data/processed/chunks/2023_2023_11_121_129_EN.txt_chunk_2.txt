Patwalia for the appellants submitted that the lands in question were being used both for commercial and residential purposes and the High Court had erred in not relying upon the sale deeds executed for the shops prior to the date of acquisition, which showed continuous rise in the prices. 5. He further submitted that the High Court had committed gross error in applying one third cut on the assessed market value of Rs.3,000/- per marla, towards development charges though admittedly the lands acquired were situated within the Municipal limits of the villages. The structures/ buildings standing thereon, clearly established that the acquired lands were neither undeveloped nor underdeveloped lands. He relied upon the case of Haryana State Industrial Development Corporation vs. Pran Sukh and Others1 to buttress his submissions. 6. The learned counsel for the respondent state however submitted that when a large chunk of land is being acquired, a suitable deduction is required to be made towards the development charges as per the settled legal position, which has rightly been done by the High Court.
