31. For the aforesaid reasons, the impugned before us in Criminal Appeal Number 1795 of 2004 dated 21 September 2010, is set aside. The appeal is, accordingly, allowed. 32. Having allowed the appeals as above, we are constrained to observe that the Criminal Appeal u/s 378 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the High Court has not appreciated the severity of the allegations involved to the full extent. That a Court of Appeal should be circumspect in overturning its of acquittal, is not a principle that requires reiteration. It has been held time and again that an acquittal will only be overturned in the presence of very compelling reasons.42 Further, right from the Privy Council43 onwards, it is been held that the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused is bolstered if the trial court hands down an acquittal.44 We fi nd the High Court not to have observed the said principles in deciding the appeals. Quite opposite thereto, perfunctory reasons stand recorded to restore the convictions of the Appellants herein. The observations of the trial court along with the principle of a bolstered principle of innocence, were summarily cast aside. The same cannot be said to be in accordance with the law. 33. As a result, the acquittals handed down by and dated 25th September 2004 in S.C. No. 162 of 1999, passed by the Additional Sessions Judge- Presiding Offi cer, Fast Track Court-II, Kolar, are restored. The of conviction and sentence, as awarded by the High Court, stands set aside. 34. Since the sentence awarded by the High Court under Section 304 Part II of the IPC was for 4 years, and the application of exemption from surrender was disallowed by this Court, vide dated 13th December 2010, the Appellants appear to have already served the sentence awarded to them. 42 Tulsiram Kanu v State AIR 1954 SC 1 43 Sheo Swarup v King Emperor AIR 1934 PC 227(2) 44 Ghurey Lal v State of U.P.

Consequently, bail bonds, if in eff ectuation, shall stand discharged. The appeal is accordingly, allowed. 36. In view of the above, interlocutory applications, if any, shall stand disposed of.
