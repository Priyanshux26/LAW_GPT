The A.P. Amendment permits inspection being carried out by the Collector by having access to the documents which are 98 (2009) 9 SCC 1 99 (2016) 10 SCC 726 100 (1997) 1 SCC 301 H 101 (2005) 1 SCC 496 KAUSHAL KISHOR v. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH & ORS. 689 [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] in private custody i.e. custody other than that of a public officer. A It is clear that this provision empowers invasion of the home of the person in whose possession the documents “tending” to or leading to the various facts stated in Section 73 are in existence and Section 73 being one without any safeguards as to probable or reasonable cause or reasonable basis or materials violates the B right to privacy both of the house and of the person. We have already referred to R. Rajagopal case [(1994) 6 SCC 632] wherein the learned Judges have held that the right to personal liberty also means life free from encroachments unsustainable in law, and such right flowing from Article 21 of the Constitution. C 56. In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India [(1978) 1 SCC 248] a seven-Judge Bench decision, P.N. Bhagwati, J. (as His Lordship then was) held that the expression “personal liberty” in Article 21 is of the widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights which go to constitute the personal liberty of man and some of them have been raised to the status of distinct fundamental rights and D given additional protection under Article 19 (emphasis supplied). Any law interfering with personal liberty of a person must satisfy a triple test: (i) it must prescribe a procedure; (ii) the procedure must withstand the test of one or more of the fundamental rights conferred under Article 19 which may be applicable in a given E situation; and (iii) it must also be liable to be tested with reference to Article 14. As the test propounded by Article 14 pervades Article 21 as well, the law and procedure authorising interference with personal liberty and right of privacy must also be right and just and fair and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive. If the procedure prescribed does not satisfy the requirement of Article 14 it would F be no procedure at all within the meaning of Article 21.” 99.
