In considering the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty, it is appropriate to compare them with the terms generally or commonly used in to convey the idea that a delimitation is intended. Whenever in the past a special agreement has entrusted the Court with a task related to delimitation, it has spelled out very clearly what was asked of the Court: the formulation of principles or rules enabling the parties to agree on delimitation, the precise application of these principles or rules (see North Sea Continental Shelf cases, Continental Shelf (Tunisia/Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) and Continental Shelf (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya/Malta) cases), or the actual task of drawing the delimitation line (Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary in the Gulf of Maine Area case). Likewise, in the Anglo- French Arbitration of 1977, the Tribunal was specifi cally entrusted by the terms of the Special Agreement with the drawing of the line. *********************** 83 G. Fitzmaurice, ‘The Law and Procedure of the International Court of Justice: Treaty Interpretation and Certain Other Treaty Points’ (1951) 29 British Yearbook of International Law 8. 84 ICJR (1992) 351 - Decision dated 12-09-1992, [General List No. 75] 120 4 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. 389. On the underlying question of the status of the waters of the Gulf which was thus raised before the Central American Court, there were by then three matters which practice and the 1917 Judgement took account of: fi rst, the practice of all three coastal States had established and mutually recognized a 1 marine league (3 nautical miles) littoral maritime belt off their respective mainland coasts and islands (see the passage of the 1917 Judgement quoted in paragraph 400 below), in which belt they each exercised an exclusive jurisdiction and sovereignty, though with rights of innocent passage conceded on a mutual basis; second, all three States recognized a further belt of 3 marine leagues (9 nautical miles) for rights of “maritime inspection” for fi scal purposes and for national security; third, there was an Agreement of 1900 between Honduras and Nicaragua by which a partial maritime boundary between the two States had been delimited, which, however, stopped well short of the waters of the main entrance to the bay. ************************* 410. If the Gulf is an historic bay, it is necessary to determine the closing line of the waters of the bay. The normal geographical closing line for the waters of the Gulf of Fonseca would be the line Punta Amapala to Punta Cosigüina. This seems to have been the closing line recognized by the three coastal States in practice. It is, moreover, the closing line referred to in the 1917 Judgement (loc cit., p. 706). It had not been necessary to say more, had not El Salvador elaborated a thesis of an “inner Gulf” and an “outer Gulf”, based on the reference in the Judgement of 1917, to an inner closing line from Punta Chiquirin, through Meanguera and Meanguerita, to Punta Rosario. The purpose of El Salvador’s reference to this inner line, in its argument before the Chamber, was apparently to suggest that the Honduran legal interest in the Gulf waters was limited to the area inside the inner line, the remainder being left to El Salvador and Nicaragua.
