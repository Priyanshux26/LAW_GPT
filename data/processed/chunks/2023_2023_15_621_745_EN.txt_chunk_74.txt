14. This principle has been consistently applied by the Court to determine whether the non-signatory is a party to an arbitration agreement in accordance with Section 7(4)(b).26 Our courts and tribunals have suffi ciently developed the interpretive tools to determine the intention of the parties to refer disputes to arbitration by construing the express language in the correspondence. It has also been held that once the terms of the contract show that there is an intention to refer disputes to arbitration, parties cannot “wriggle out” of the arbitration agreement.27 23 Shakti Bhog Foods v. Kola Shipping Ltd, (2009) 2 SCC 134, para 17 [2008 INSC 1081]. 24 (2001) 7 SCC 728 [2001 INSC 417]. 25 ibid, paras 6-7. 26 Unissi (India) Pvt Ltd v.

LTD. & ANR. 725 [PAMIDIGHANTAM SRI NARASIMHA, J.] 15. Having considered the statutory scheme and also the consistent approach of this Court in interpreting and construing the existence or lack of intention to arbitrate, the following principle can be restated: i. An arbitration agreement is a contract. It must meet the requirements of an agreement enforceable by law under the Indian Contract Act, 1872.28 ii. Section 7(2) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 recognises the existence of an arbitration agreement in substance, rather than in form.29 The agreement may be in the form of an arbitration clause in a contract or it may be in the form of a separate agreement. iii. Section 7(3) mandates that the arbitration agreement shall be in writing, as against an oral agreement. However, the written form of the document evidencing the agreement need not be signed by the parties.30 iv. ‘Party’ is defi ned in Section 2(1)(h) as “a party to an arbitration agreement”. The determination of the arbitration agreement and its parties are inextricably connected with one another, their existence is based on the written agreement. v. If the arbitration agreement is evidenced in the written form as contained in a document signed by the parties (Section 7(4)(a)), the parties to the agreement are evidently those who have signed the agreement. vi. If the arbitration agreement is evidenced in the written form as contained as admissions in pleadings comprising statements of claim and defence (Section 7(4)(c)), parties to this agreement would be evident from the statements of claim and defence and the admissions made therein. 28 Vidya Drolia (supra), para 21. 29 Nimet Resources Inc v.
