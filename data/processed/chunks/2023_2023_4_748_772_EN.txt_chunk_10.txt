Such a course would indeed be disastrous. A far more just, reasonable and proper course would be to expand the G options and to take over what, as a matter of fact, lawfully belongs to the Court i.e. the vast hiatus between 14 years’ imprisonment and death. It needs to be emphasised that the Court would take recourse to the expanded option primarily 26 [1976] Supp. 1 SCR 552: (1976) 3 SCC 470 H 762 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A because in the facts of the case, the sentence of 14 years’ imprisonment would amount to no punishment at all.” 16. The appropriateness of imposing a punishment (termed as a special or fixed term sentence) in serious crimes, which carried, as a sentencing option, the death penalty (apart from life sentence), was B considered by this court in Sriharan. The majority decision, after considering the previous decisions, held that the ratio in Swamy Shraddananda (supra) was correct. Commenting on the decision in Swamy Shraddananda, the court held in Sriharan that [SCR, p. 701; and 710-711]: C “87. […] What all it seeks to declare by stating so was that within the prescribed limit of the punishment of life imprisonment, having regard to the nature of offence committed by imposing the life imprisonment for a specified period would be proportionate to the crime as well as the interest of the victim, whose interest is also to be taken care D of by the Court, when considering the nature of punishment to be imposed. ********************* *************** 104. We, therefore, reiterate that the power derived from the Penal Code for any modified punishment within the E punishment provided for in the Penal Code for such specified offences can only be exercised by the High Court and in the event of further appeal only by the Supreme Court and not by any other court in this country. To put it differently, the power to impose a modified punishment providing for any F specific term of incarceration or till the end of the convict’s life as an alternate to death penalty, can be exercised only by the High Court and the Supreme Court and not by any other inferior court. 105. Viewed in that respect, we state that the ratio laid down G in Swamy Shraddananda (2) v. State of Karnataka, (2008) 13 SCC 767] that a special category of sentence; instead of death; for a term exceeding 14 years and put that category beyond application of remission is well founded and we answer the said question in the affirmative. We are, therefore, not in agreement with the opinion expressed by this Court in H VIKAS CHAUDHARY v. THE STATE OF DELHI 763 [S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.] Sangeet v. State of Haryana, (2013) 2 SCC 452 that the A deprival of remission power of the appropriate Government by awarding sentences of 20 or 25 years or without any remission as not permissible is not in consonance with the law and we specifically overrule the same.” 17.
