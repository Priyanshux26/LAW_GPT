[Para 21] Consumer Protection – Awareness – Food and health sector – Promote mechanism for consumer complaints: Held: All the statutory provisions/rules, regulations and guidelines have a salutary object, which is to serve the consumers and 376 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports ensure that they are made aware of the kind of product that is being offered for purchase, particularly in the food and health sector – This Court is of the opinion that the concerned Ministries ought to set up and promote a mechanism which encourages the consumer to lodge a complaint and for the said complaint to be taken to its logical conclusion, instead of simply being marked/forwarded to the concerned State authority, thus leaving the consumer clueless as to the final outcome of the complaint made.
