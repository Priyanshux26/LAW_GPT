20. It was submitted that as the specific allegations pertain to cheating, criminal conspiracy and trespass, being cognizable offences under the IPC, and the same relating to the property belonging to the D Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes community would attract provisions of the SC/ST Act. It was reiterated that the property in question belongs to the respondent no. 2 and her family members, and any construction raised on the subject-land is by creating forged documents. 21. It was then contended that the Court is to be highly circumspect E in interfering with investigation and quashing of FIRs. In support of his contentions, learned counsel relied upon the following s, and the paragraphs indicated alongside: i. State of Madhya Pradesh v Surendra Kori, (2012) 10 SCC 155 @ Paras 14 and 16. F ii. Dineshbhai Chandubhai Patel v State of Gujarat, (2018) 3 SCC 104 @ Paras 30-31 iii. Satvinder Kaur v State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi), (1999) 8 SCC 728@ Para 16 G iv.

Further, advancing that the FIR was not required to be an A encyclopaedia, which must disclose all facts and details of the offence(s) alleged or complained of, learned counsel relied upon Superintendent of Police, CBI v Tapan Kumar Singh, (2003) 6 SCC 175(at Para 20) and State of Uttar Pradesh v Naresh, (2011) 4 SCC 324 (at Para 32). B SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT NO.1/THE STATE: 23. Learned counsel for the State submitted that the matter involves disputed questions of fact which this Court would not go into. It was the submission that the case be left to be investigated into by the police. C Further, it was submitted that Dineshbhai Chandubhai Patel (supra) has held that it is the duty of the Investigating Officer to probe the crime, and that the High Court is not to act as an Investigating Officer. ANALYSIS, REASONING AND CONCLUSION: 24. Having considered the matter, this Court finds that a case for D interference is made out. The basic facts to be noticed are: (a) that the land-owners with whom GMID had entered into the JDA, had purchased the land in 1954-1955, and; (b) the occupancy rights were also created in the original land-owners’ favour on 09.07.1961. From then onwards, no dispute was raised by any person before any authority and only after E the GMID entered into the JDA with the original land-owners in the year 2009, obtained all clearances from the authorities in their favour, started the construction work and built apartments numbering more than 400, sold them to the buyers/allottees in the year 2017, did the present dispute arise. This itself indicates a lack of bonafide.
