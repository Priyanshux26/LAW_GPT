However, if the rules have been made but they are silent on any subject or point in issue, the omission can be supplied and the rules can be supplemented by executive instructions (See: Sant Ram Sharma v. State of Rajasthan [AIR 1967 SC 1910 : (1968) 1 SCR 111 : (1968) 2 LLJ 830] .) 8 (1995) 6 SCC 1 708 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. 32. In the instant case, the Government did neither issue any administrative instruction nor did it supply the omission with regard to the criteria on the basis of which suitability of the candidates was to be determined. The members of the Selection Board, of their own, decided to adopt the confi dential character rolls of the candidates who were already employed as Homoeopathic Medical Offi cers, as the basis for determining their suitability. 33. The members of the Selection Board or for that matter, any other Selection Committee, do not have the jurisdiction to lay down the criteria for selection unless they are authorised specifi cally in that regard by the Rules made under Article 309……” [Emphasis added] (Also refer : B.S. Yadav and Others v. State of Haryana and Others9; P.K. Ramachandra Iyer and Others v. Union of India and Others10; Umesh Chandra Shukla v. Union of India and Others11; and Durgacharan Misra v. State of Orissa12) 10.2. In Bedanga Talukdar v. Saifudaullah Khan and Others13, this Court highlighted the fact that any power of relaxation of the stipulated selection procedure ought to be mentioned in the advertisement in the following words:- “29. We have considered the entire matter in detail. In our opinion, it is too well settled to need any further reiteration that all appointments to public offi ce have to be made in conformity with Article 14 of the Constitution of India. In other words, there must be no arbitrariness resulting from any undue favour being shown to any candidate. Therefore, the selection process has to be conducted strictly in accordance with the stipulated selection procedure. Consequently, when a particular schedule is mentioned in an advertisement, the same has to be scrupulously maintained. There cannot be any relaxation in the terms and conditions of the advertisement 9 (1980) Supp. SCC 524 10 (1984) 2 SCC 141 11 (1985) 3 SCC 721 12 (1987) 4 SCC 646 13 (2011) 12 SCC 85 NUTAN KUMARI v. B.R.A. BIHAR UNIVERSITY 709 unless such a power is specifi cally reserved. Such a power could be reserved in the relevant statutory rules. Even if power of relaxation is provided in the rules, it must still be mentioned in the advertisement. In the absence of such power in the rules, it could still be provided in the advertisement. However, the power of relaxation, if exercised, has to be given due publicity. This would be necessary to ensure that those candidates who become eligible due to the relaxation, are aff orded an equal opportunity to apply and compete. Relaxation of any condition in advertisement without due publication would be contrary to the mandate of equality contained in Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India.
