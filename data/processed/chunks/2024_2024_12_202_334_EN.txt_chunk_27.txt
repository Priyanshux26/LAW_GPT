He submitted that the amendments carried out in the Act, 1962 vide Sections 87 and 88 of the Finance Act, 2022 respectively are a mere surplusage done ex abundanti cautela and are clarificatory in nature. He further submitted that Section 3 deals with classes of officers and officers of the same rank will constitute the same class. The amended Section 5 only expands the very same class with designation and functions and nothing more. 50. He submitted that Section 94 of the Finance Act, 2022 introducing Section 110AA to the Act, 1962 is only a way forward for the future wherein post search and investigation by the DRI, certain category of cases have now been directed to be handed over to the port authorities for issuing necessary show cause notices and this, in no way, can vitiate notices issued by DRI earlier especially in the absence of a constitutional or statutory embargo. [2024] 12 S.C.R. 245 Commissioner of Customs v. M/s Canon India Pvt. Ltd. 51. Finally, he submitted that a provision of law should appear arbitrary or abusive to be declared illegal or unconstitutional or invalid. A possible misuse of the provision by the authorities or a perceived misuse or mere presumptions and conjectures of a possible misuse cannot constitute basis to hold that a provision is arbitrary and violative of Article 14. He relied on the following decisions to fortify his submission: a. Collector of Customs v. Nathella Sampathu Chetty, 1962 SCC OnLine SC 30 b. Shreya Singhal v. Union of India (2015) 5 SCC 1 c. Commissioner of Customs v. Dilip Kumar & Co. (2018) 9 SCC 1 d. Goodyear India Ltd. v. State of Haryana (1990) 2 SCC 71 C. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 52. Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, Mr. Arvind Datar and Mr. V. Lakshmikumaran, learned Senior Counsel appeared on behalf of the various importers and vehemently objected to the review of Canon India (supra) and also contended that both Sayed Ali (supra) and Mangali Impex (supra) are correct in their conclusions and need no interference. 53. Mr. Mukul Rohatgi contended that the power of review is extremely circumscribed and limited. It is not a means to provide a second innings to anyone. The Department in the guise of a review is seeking to re-argue the whole matter. Even if a different view is possible, the same cannot give rise to a review. He relied on the following decisions: (i) Col. Avtar Singh Sekhon v. Union of India (1980) Supp SCC 562 (ii) Lily Thomas Vs Union of India (2000) 6 SCC 224 (iii) Champsey Bhara & Co. v. Jivraj Balloo Spinning and Weaving Co. Ltd. (1923) SCC OnLine PC 10 (iv) State of Telangana v. Mohd. Abdul Qasim (2024) 6 SCC 461. 54. Mr. Arvind Datar too submitted that the scope of review is extremely limited and further contended that Section 97 of the Finance Act, 2022 is a clear overreach and needs to be considered separately. 246 [2024] 12 S.C.R.
