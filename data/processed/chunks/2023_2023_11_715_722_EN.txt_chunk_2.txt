Kotwali Gursahaiganj, Kannauj. The Investigating Offi cer, after completing the investigation, submitted the Final Report bearing No.164/2017 on 13.11.2017. 5. Being aggrieved by the said report, the appellant-complainant fi led a Protest Petition being F.R. No.06/11/18 before the concerned CJM. The concerned CJM vide dated 15.11.2018 rejected the Final Report of the Investigating Offi cer and directed that the Protest Petition be registered as the Complaint Case. The said complaint case was registered and numbered as the Complaint No.2783/2018. 6. The concerned CJM having regard to the provisions contained in Sections 200 and 202 Cr.P.C. and after recording the statements of the complainant and eight other witnesses, issued summons to the respondents- accused vide dated 11.01.2022 in the said complaint case. Being aggrieved by the said passed on 11.01.2022, the respondents-accused preferred an application under Section 482 bearing No.14899/2022 before the High Court. 7. On 20.07.2022, the respondents-accused, who were the applicants before the High Court, submitted an application seeking amendment in the prayer clause of the application fi led under Section 482 and prayed for setting aside of the dated 15.11.2018 as well. The said application for amendment came to be allowed by the High Court vide the impugned dated 21.07.2022. On the very next day, the High Court after hearing the learned counsel for the parties passed the impugned on 22.07.2022, allowing the said application under Section 482 as stated hereinabove. 8. The High Court while passing the impugned , observed as under: - ZUNAID v. STATE OF UP. & ORS. 719 “20. When the fi ndings recorded by concerned Magistrate as noted above, are examined in the light of the observations contained in paragraph 28 of the judgement in Hari Ram (supra) do not fulfi ll the mandate of law which the Magistrate is required to comply while exercising jurisdiction under Section 190 (1) (b) Cr.P.C. No fi nding has been recorded by concerned Magistrate with regard to the papers accompanying the police report. Without recording any fi nding that there is no evidence against applicants in the papers accompanying police report, the conclusion drawn by Magistrate to treat the protest petition as a complaint is not only illegal, but also arbitrary. Once the Magistrate came to prima facie conclusion that investigation of concerned case crime number is unsatisfactory or is the outcome of lackadaisical approach of investigating Offi cer, then in that eventuality, concerned Magistrate ought to have directed further investigation in the matter. The fi ndings recorded by concerned Magistrate in support of his conclusion to treat the protest petition as a complaint are by themselves insuffi cient to proceed with the protest petition as a complaint.” 9. In our opinion, the above observations recorded by the High Court are absolutely erroneous in view of the catena of decisions of this Court. 10. In Rakesh & Another Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh & Another1, it is observed as under: - “6. If we are to go back to trace the genesis of the views expressed by this Court in Gopal Vijay Verma v. Bhuneshwar Prasad Sinha, (1982) 3 SCC 510, notice must be had of the decision of this Court in H.S.
