14. The appellant is engaged in the business of manufacturing, G marketing and sales of household insecticide products in various forms, viz. mosquito coils, mats, refills, aerosols, baits and chalks under the popular brand name “Good Knight” and “Hit” from, inter alia, its sales office at Kurukshetra, and is an ‘assessee’ under the VAT Act. 15. In terms of section 7 of the VAT Act, the taxable goods have H been classified under Schedules A, B and C. It is found from Schedule M/S GODREJ SARA LEE LTD. v. THE EXCISE AND TAXATION 883 OFFICER-CUM-ASSESSING AUTHORITY [DIPANKAR DATTA, J.] C (as originally enacted) that pesticides, weedicides and insecticides A were included in Entry 1 and taxable @ 4%. 16. Returns were filed by the appellant for the Assessment Years 2003-04 and 2004-05 declaring its gross turnover from manufacturing and sales of insecticides and pesticides, besides other consumer goods. Such returns were duly accepted. However, in view of an amendment B in Entry 67 of Schedule C introduced by a notification dated 30th June, 2005, notices were issued by the Assessing Authority as to why tax liability @ 10% instead of 4% should not be imposed. Upon hearing the representative of the appellant, s dated 28th February, 2007 and 28th March, 2008 were passed by the Assessing Authority for the C Assessment Years 2003-04 and 2004-05, respectively, accepting the classification of goods and the rate of tax as stated by the appellant in its returns, i.e. 4%. 17. Subsequently, the Revisional Authority called for the assessment records of the appellant for the Assessment Years 2003-04 D and 2004-05 for revision of the assessment on classifying the household insecticide products of the appellant as mosquito repellants and taxable at the higher rate of tax, i.e. 10%, instead of 4%. Initially, show-cause notices seeking to revise the assessments made for the Assessment Years 2003-04 and 2004-05 were issued, and such exercise was followed up by identically worded final s, both dated 2nd March, 2009. E 18. Several legal questions including validity of certain notifications were raised by the appellant before the High Court in its writ petition. Apart from the question as to whether mosquito repellants are goods classifiable as insecticides, pesticides, weedicides, etc., one other question which the appellant sought to raise was whether an amendment in the F schedule of classification/rates of tax could be applied to completed assessments for the assessment years prior to the amendment coming into effect. However, before us, the only limited question which the appellant raised was, whether the s of the Revisional Authority, both dated 2nd March, 2009, seeking to revise the s of the Assessing Authority dated 28th February, 2007 and 28th March, 2008 pertaining to G the Assessment Years 2003-04 and 2004-05, have been issued in exercise of jurisdiction conferred by law. 19. For facility of understanding, it would be convenient at this stage to reproduce the material part from the revisional passed in respect of the Assessment Year 2004-05, below: H 884 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R.
