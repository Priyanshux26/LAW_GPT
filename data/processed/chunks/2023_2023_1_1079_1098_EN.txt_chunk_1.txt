It has been held by this court, in Sailen Krishna Majumdar v Malik Labhu Masih that in such cases, even if equities are equal, the court should not intervene.

Thereafter, the developer issued an allotment letter dated 21.05.1992, earmarking Flat No. D-301 (3rd floor) with a super built- up area of 1375 sq. ft. in the Scheme. Dr Manjeet Kaur Monga deposited two further instalments, G with the sixth instalment deposited in September 1993. Eight years later, i.e., in December 2001, a demand notice for payment of the eighth and ninth instalments was issued to the complainant.

The developer however, issued a letter thereafter, cancelling the allotment of the complainant’s flat on 30th April 2005.
