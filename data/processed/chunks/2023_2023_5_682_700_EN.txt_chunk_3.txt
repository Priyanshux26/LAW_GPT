However, in the light of communication dated 18.11.2006, essentially recognizing and in substance conveying acceptance H 686 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A or approval; first respondent cannot draw strength from the same. IOC has a case that it was for taking the matter forward in the matter of re-awarding the dealership that the decision dated 07.12.2006 was made. More importantly, the communication purporting to take back the withdrawal was given by first respondent on 11.12.2006 which is after 07.12.2006. [Para B 25][699-A; 699-E-F] 1.9 Proceeding on the basis that acceptance is necessary, the High Court in a proceeding under Section 37 acted illegally in interfering with the finding of the arbitrator and what is more, a finding found acceptable to the District Judge under Section 34 C that there was acceptance vide letter dated 18.11.2006. [Para 26][699-G-H] 1.10 The High Court also erred in proceeding to restoration of the dealership to the first respondent after setting aside the award and going further by leaving it open to the first D respondent to claim damages. The Court cannot, after setting aside the award, proceed to grant further relief by modifying the award. It must leave the parties to work out their remedies in a given case even where it justifiably interferes with the award. Thus, the impugned is set aside and the award is E restored.
