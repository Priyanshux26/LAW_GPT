The proceedings in the appeal shall now be listed before a Bench presided over by the Chairperson of the NCLAT for hearing and fi nal disposal of the appeal. We have not made any observations on the merits of the rival contentions. 32 The issues which are sought to be raised by Mr Deepak Khosla, counsel appearing on behalf of the intervenor, have nothing to do with the main proceedings before this Court. Hence it is not necessary to entertain the Interlocutory Application. The IA is accordingly dismissed. 33 The Contempt Proceedings are accordingly disposed of in terms of the above directions. 34 Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.
