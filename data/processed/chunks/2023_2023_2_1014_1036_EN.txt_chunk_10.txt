Therefore if he has not misdirected himself as to the scope of the enquiry made under Section 202 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and has judicially applied his mind to the material C before him and then proceeds to make his it cannot be said that he has acted erroneously. An of dismissal under Section 203 of the Criminal Procedure Code, is, however, no bar to the entertainment of a second complaint on the same facts but it will be entertained only in exceptional circumstances, e.g., where the D previous was passed on an incomplete record or on a misunderstanding of the nature of the complaint or it was manifestly absurd, unjust or foolish or where new facts which could not, with reasonable diligence, have been brought on the record in the previous proceedings, have been adduced. It cannot be said to be in the interests of justice that after a decision has been given E against the complainant upon a full consideration of his case, he or any other person should be given another opportunity to have his complaint enquired into. Allah Ditta v. Karam Bakhsh [Allah Ditta v. Karam Bakhsh, 1930 SCC OnLine Lah 268 : AIR 1930 Lah 879] ; R.N. Choubey v. P. Jain [R.N. Choubey v. P.

In regard to the adducing of new G facts for the bringing of a fresh complaint the Special Bench in the under appeal did not accept the view of the Bombay High Court [Hansabai Sayaji Payagude v. Ananda Ganuji Payagude, 1949 SCC OnLine Bom 99 : AIR 1949 Bom 384] or the Patna High Court [R.N. Choubey v. P. Jain, 1948 SCC OnLine H 1030 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 2 S.C.R. A Pat 85 : AIR 1949 Pat 256] in the cases above quoted and adopted the opinion of Maclean, C.J. in Queen Empress v. Dolegobind Dass [Queen Empress v. Dolegobind Dass, 1900 SCC OnLine Cal 229 : ILR (1901) 28 Cal 211] affirmed by a Full Bench in Dwarka Nath Mondul v. Beni Madhab Banerjee [Dwarka Nath Mondul v. Beni Madhab Banerjee, 1901 SCC OnLine Cal 242 : B ILR (1901) 28 Cal 652] . It held therefore that a fresh complaint can be entertained where there is manifest error, or manifest miscarriage of justice in the previous or when fresh evidence is forthcoming.” 15.
