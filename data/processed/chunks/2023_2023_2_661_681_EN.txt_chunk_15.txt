PW-8 did not speak about the presence of PW-10 and also about such a query made by Raju Pande. 28. For all the above reasons and circumstances, it is unsafe to F rest on the sole testimony of PW-8 to apply the ‘last seen theory’ in this case against the appellants especially, going by PW-8 he had only nodding acquaintance with them. 29. Thus, in a nutshell the correctness of the last seen version emanating from PW-8-Chintaman becomes doubtful, especially against G the appellants herein. As noticed earlier, virtually, the oral testimonies of PW-8 and PW-10 are at variance about the last seen and it becomes inconclusive for the reasons mentioned hereinbefore. We have also found that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the alleged motive. In such circumstance, though the deceased had met with a homicidal death it cannot be said that the rest of the circumstantial evidence culled out H SHANKAR v. THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA 681 [C. T. RAVIKUMAR, J.] by the courts below unerringly point to the culpability of the appellants in A the homicidal death of Rahul Pundlik Meshram. Even the recovery of the weapon and the dress, at the instance of the appellant in the latter appeal cannot, by itself, be conclusive as admittedly, the panch witnesses for their recovery also did not support the prosecution. In our considered view, the remaining circumstances relied on by the prosecution and held B as proved by the courts below would not unerringly point to the guilt of the appellants. 30. Thus, in our view, it is unsafe on the aforesaid circumstances to maintain the conviction of the appellants; we thus, extend to them the benefit of doubt. Accordingly, we for the acquittal of the appellants. C The appeals are thus allowed, upsetting the s and s of the High Court as also that of the court of Session. The bail bonds executed by the appellants stand discharged. Nidhi Jain Appeals allowed. D (Assisted by : George J. and Rakhi, LCRAs) E F G H
