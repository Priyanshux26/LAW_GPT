By its impugned dated 25 July 2006, the High Court has held that no continuity of service could be granted on account of her absence from service over a period of 782 days, as noted above. The of the Single Judge dated 25 July G 2006 has been affirmed in appeal by the Division Bench on 17 February 2009. The matter has hence travelled to this Court. 3 Special Civil Application No 9723 of 2002 4 Special Civil Application No 14636 of 2006 H BHARTIBEN CHANDRAKANTBHAI THAKOR v. STATE OF 715 GUJARAT [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] 9. We have heard Mr Nachiketa Joshi, counsel appearing on behalf A of the appellant and Ms Swati Ghildiyal, counsel for the State of Gujarat. 10. The appellant had submitted her resignation on 18 April 1993, but withdrew it on 23 November 1993. The accepting the resignation was passed much thereafter on 23/26 December 1994. This was set aside by the High Court. While the Single Judge had directed the B grant of all consequential benefits, the Division Bench in a Letters Patent Appeal modified the to the extent that the appellant was held not to be entitled to any benefits for the period for which the resignation was in force. Hence, as a consequence of the of the Division Bench in the Letters Patent Appeal, the appellant was not entitled to any C consequential benefits between 18 April 1993 and 20 December 1993. 11. The expression “for the period for which resignation was in force” cannot be stretched to a date after the resignation had been withdrawn on 23 November 1993 before it came into force. 12. Despite the above position, two s were passed thereafter D on 8 April 2002 and 17 July 2002. Both the s were set aside by the High Court on 9 August 2004 with a direction to the respondents to pay consequential benefits between November 1993 and March 2001 with interest. 13. Even after the appellant succeeded in the second writ petition, E a further was passed on 16 July 2005. Of the three periods which are referred to in the third dated 16 July 2005, it is evident that the first period of 41 days is between June 1988 and July 1988 which is prior to the date of the resignation from service. The second period between April and November 1993 of 220 days is the period after the submission of the resignation and till its withdrawal which already formed the subject F matter of the passed by the Division Bench on 22 February 2001. The final period of 521 days however is between 6 November 1991 and 7 April 1993. This period has been set up in the which was passed on 16 July 2005. Clearly, it was not open to the State to continue passing successive of this nature once the dispute over the period of G resignation and the manner in which the resignation had to be treated had attained finality. The appellant was not entitled to any consequential benefits only for the period between 18 April 1993 to 23 November 1993.
