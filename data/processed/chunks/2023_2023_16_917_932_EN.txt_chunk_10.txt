23. Thus, even on this count, the plan submitted in question will not incur the disqualifi cation. We may also note that the aforesaid intent is 932 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. refl ected in the statutory provision itself that in Section 29A (c) which begins with “at the time of submission of the resolution plan”. 24. It is also pointed out that even if it was an NPA, the defect can be cured as set out in proviso (1) before submission of the plan, making the submission of the plan the crucial date. 25. We are thus, setting aside the impugned s of the NCLT dated 28.02.2023 and NCLAT dated 02.06.2023 and allow the appeal leaving parties to bear their own costs. 26. We appreciate the assistance rendered by Mr. Bishwajit Dubey, learned Amicus. 27. As a sequiter, IA No.192/2022 in C.P. (IB) No.196/BB/2020 before the Adjudicating Authority would stand restored to National Company Law Tribunal for reconsideration. 28. Needless to say any consequential action in pursuance to the impugned taken by the IBBI against the appellant will not survive. IA No.230784/2023 for Intervention In view of the view we have taken in the appeal, the application stands disposed of. Headnotes prepared by: Appeal allowed. Divya Pandey
