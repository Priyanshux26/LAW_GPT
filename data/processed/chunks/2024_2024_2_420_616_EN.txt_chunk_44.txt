In Common Cause (A Registered Society) v. Union of India,” this Court dwelt on the ostentatious use of money by political parties in elections to further the prospects of candidates set up by them. Justice Kuldip Singh described the role of money in the electoral process, which is relevant for contextualizing the issue: “18. ... [The General Elections] is an enormous exercise and amammoth venture in terms of money spent. Hundreds and thousands of vehicles of various kinds are pressed on to the roads in 543 parliamentary constituencies on behalf of thousands of aspirants to power, many days 70 [1927 S5CR ]25 9 : (1975) 3 SCC 646 71 [1927 S5CR ]38 4 : (1975) 4 SCC 127 72 [19Supp8. 51 SC]R 6 22 : 1985 Supp SCC 189 73 [193 9SC6R ]120 8 : (1996) 2 SCC 752 484 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports before the general elections are actually held. Millions of leaflets and many million posters are printed and distributed or pasted all over the country. Banners by the lakhs are hoisted. Flags go up, walls are painted, and hundreds of thousands of loudspeakers play out the loud exhortations and extravagant promises. VIPs and VVIPs come and go, some of them in helicopters and air-taxis. The political parties in their quest for power spend more than one thousand crore of rupees on the General Election (Parliament alone), yet nobody accounts for the bulk of money so spent and there is no accountability anywhere. Nobody discloses the source of the money. There are no proper accounts and no audit. From where does the money come from nobody knows. In a democracy where rule of law prevails this naked display of black money, by violating the mandatory provisions of law, cannot be permitted.” 55. The challenge to the statutory amendments and the Electoral Bond Scheme cannot be adjudicated in isolation without a reference to the actual impact of money on electoral politics. This Court has in numerous s held that the effect and not the object of the law on fundamental rights and other constitutional provisions must be determined while adjudicating its constitutional validity. The effect of provisions dealing with electoral finance cannot be determined without recognizing the influence of money on politics. Therefore, we must bear in mind the nexus between money and electoral democracy while deciding on the issues which are before us in this batch of petitions. F. Thechallenge to non-disclosure of information on electoral financing 56. Section 29C of the RPA as amended by the Finance Act 2017 stipulates that the political party need not disclose financial contributions received through electoral bonds. Similarly, Section 13A of the IT Act aS amended does not require the political party to maintain a record of contributions for contributions received through electoral bonds. Section 182 of the Companies Act 2013 as amended by the Finance Act 2017 by which the earlier requirement of disclosure of particulars of the amount contributed by companies to political parties in their profit and loss accounts was deleted.
