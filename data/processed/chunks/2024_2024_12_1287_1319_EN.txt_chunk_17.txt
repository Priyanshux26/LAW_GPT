In the instant case, after having kept quiet for a period of almost 07 years i.e., from 21.11.2014 till 12.08.2021 (till filing of IA No.98276 of 2021), no effective steps were taken by the State and its instrumentalities to implement the s of this Court except exchange of inter- departmental correspondence which is already noticed herein above. 19. The affidavits of the Commissioner of BDA and Chief Commissioner of BBMP would reflect as though there is due compliance of the aforesaid two s passed by this Court and this is not only in clear violation of the s 21.11.2014 but also dated 17.05.2022 whereunder this Court in unequivocal terms or had categorically directed the respondents’ herein to issue TDR as per the TDR Rules and nothing short or long of it. In other words, the TDR which was required to be issued ought to have been as per the Karnataka Town and Country Planning (Benefit of Development Rights) Rules, 2016. This Court by dated 19.03.2024 after hearing the matter for some time had passed the aforesaid . 20. A perusal of the same would indicate that this Court in no uncertain terms and categorically has held that State should issue necessary TDR as directed by this Court on 21.11,2014 and 17.05.22. In fact, specific direction was issued that there should be compliance within eight (8) weeks. It was also ed that the recipient of the TDR should undertake to return the consideration received upon sale or transfer of the TDR in the event of the civil appeals before this Court are dismissed and called upon the complainants to file an affidavit of undertaking to this effect in the nature of personal bond(s) to be furnished by the recipient of the TDR to the state before the sale or transfer of the TDR. We deem it appropriate to note at this juncture that dated 19.03.2024 was passed for implementing the s dated 21.11.2014 and 17.05.2022 and there was no occasion or necessity for this Court to impose further conditions which in effect would amount to tweaking the s dated 21.11.2014 and 17.05.2022. Infact there was no such prayer made by the State or its instrumentalities by filing appropriate applications. Attempt made in that regard by filing I.A. No. 98276 of 2021 had already been rejected by this Court by dated 17.05.2022 itself. Yet another reason which requires to be assigned for supporting such a view, 1312 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports emanates from the fact that State itself has admitted in the I.A. No. 98276 of 2021 that if TDR is to be issued as per TDR Rules the market value will have to be determined as per TDR Rules, which in effect would mean value of the land has to be determined as per the value fixed under the Karnataka Stamp Act, 1957. Accordingly, the calculation had been made and pleaded financial hardship. Though, while applying the market value as fixed under the Stamp Act, 1957, 60% of the value has been deducted which we are not in agreement for reasons detailed herein below, yet, the fact remains that State itself has admitted and adopted the value fixed under Karnataka Stamp Act, 1957 to fix the value of TDR to be issued.
