(4) If a challenge under any procedure agreed upon by the parties or under the procedure under sub- section (2) is not successful, the arbitral tribunal shall continue the arbitral proceedings and make an arbitral award. (5) Where an arbitral award is made under sub-section (4), the party challenging the arbitrator may make an application for setting aside such an arbitral award in accordance with section 34. (6) Where an arbitral award is set aside on an application made under sub-section (5), the Court may decide as to whether the arbitrator who is challenged is entitled to any fees.”] 91 Holtzmann and Neuhaus (supra) 550. 2222 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports of the award are contained in articles 23(1), 24(2)-(4), 27, 30(2), 31(1), (3), (4), 32 and 33(1), (2), (4), (5).” (emphasis supplied) 54. Ultimately, paragraph 3 of Article 19 was placed in a separate article in the form of Article 18. This was meant to distinguish two distinct issues: party autonomy to determine rules of procedure and fairness of arbitral proceedings.92 Moreover, the separation was meant to emphasise the importance of procedural fairness over the autonomy of parties to determine procedural rules. 55. Article 18 constitutes a fundamental principle that is “applicable to the entire arbitral proceedings.”93 The Working Group has also stated that the principles of equality and fairness “should be observed not only by the arbitral tribunal but also by the parties when laying down any rules of procedure.”94 It was the understanding of the Working Group that the principle of equality of parties applies to arbitral proceedings in general, including aspects such as the composition of arbitral tribunal.95 Article 18 also operates as a limitation on Article 19 which provides broad autonomy to both the parties and, in the absence of an arbitration agreement, to the arbitral tribunal when determining the procedure to be followed in conducting the arbitral proceedings.96 It imposes a duty on the arbitral tribunal to ensure fairness in the arbitral process. vi. Public-private arbitration 56. Private law is a part of common law which involves relationships between individuals by way of contract or tort.97 The demands of the modern market economy require the State to contract out certain 92 Ilias Bantekas, Equal Treatment of Parties in Ilias Bantekas, et al (eds) UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (2020, CUP) 524 93 Report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on the work of its eighteenth session (3-21 June 1985) Supplement No. 17 (A/40/17) [176]. 94 A/CN.9/246 [62] 95 Holtzmann and Neuhaus (supra) 552. [It was observed by the Secretariat that: “It had always been the understanding of the Working Group … that the fundamental principle enunciated in article 19(3) [Article 18 in the final text] would apply to arbitral proceedings in general; it would thus govern all provisions in chapter V and other aspects, such as the composition of the arbitral tribunal, not directly regulated therein.”] 96 Holtzmann and Neuhaus (supra) 551 97 K K Saksena v.
