However, the present case is distinguishable on key facts. Here, the Agreement to Sell was executed on appropriate stamp paper without irregularities, and the plaintiffs diligently discharged their burden by providing credible evidence, including the testimony of PW-1 (either the plaintiffs or their Power of Attorney holder with personal knowledge) and the attesting witness PW-2, who was not a close relative but an independent witness. Moreover, the plaintiffs produced the original title deed of 1966 and the Rin Pustika, handed over by Sushila Devi—a fact not contested by the defendants—which corroborates the genuineness of the transaction. An expert handwriting analysis affirmed the authenticity of Sushila Devi’s signature, and the defendants’ expert could not conclude otherwise. Unlike in Thiruvengadam Pillai (Supra), the plaintiffs in this case were given possession of the property, have been cultivating it, and have been paying land revenue. [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2405 Shyam Kumar Inani v. Vinod Agrawal & Ors. 34.2. The respondents further contended that Sushila Devi, being an old and illiterate lady, fell into the category of a pardanashin woman entitled to special protection under the law, as established in the case of Mst. Kharbuja Kuer (Supra). In that case, the Court held that the burden of proving that a Pardanashin lady understood the contents of a document lies on the person seeking to enforce it. However, the facts of the present case are materially different. Firstly, there is neither any pleading nor any evidence to suggest that Sushila Devi was a Pardanashin lady who lived in seclusion; mere old age and illiteracy do not suffice to classify her as such. She had independently conducted property transactions in the past, including the purchase of the suit property in 1966, demonstrating her active involvement in legal and financial matters. Secondly, the plaintiffs have adequately discharged any burden of proof by providing credible evidence that the contents of the Agreement to Sell and the General Power of Attorney were duly explained to her. The attesting witness, PW- 2, testified that the documents were read over and explained to Sushila Devi before she affixed her signature. Additionally, her son, Kailash Aggarwal, was present during the execution of these documents, and there is no allegation that he raised any objections or that any undue influence was exerted. The defendants have failed to provide any evidence to the contrary or to establish that Sushila Devi did not understand the nature of the transactions. Therefore, the reliance on the principles laid down in Mst. Kharbuja Kuer (Supra) is misplaced, as the circumstances of that case are distinguishable from the present one, and the respondents’ argument on this ground cannot be sustained. 34.3. The respondents have also relied upon the in Krishna Mohan Kul (supra), involving an old, illiterate, and physically incapacitated person who allegedly executed a deed of settlement. This Court held that when an aged, illiterate, and infirm person is involved, the burden of proving the validity of the document lies on the beneficiary, who must demonstrate that the executant was in a fit state to understand the transaction and that no undue influence was exerted.
