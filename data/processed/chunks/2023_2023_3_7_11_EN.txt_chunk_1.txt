2. Having heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties and having gone through the impugned and passed by the High Court and even the counter affidavit filed before the High Court by the Delhi Development Authority wherein it F was the specific case on behalf of the respondent therein that the possession of lands in question was taken over and handed over to the beneficiary department on 23.09.1981 and the compensation with respect to the said lands was sent in RD due to dispute. 3. However, thereafter despite the above and relying upon the G earlier decision of this Court in the case of Pune Municipal Corporation and Anr. Vs. Harakchand Misirimal Solanki and Ors., (2014) 3 SCC 183, the High Court has declared that the acquisition with respect to the lands in question is deemed to have lapsed under Section 24(2) of the Act, 2013 solely on the ground that the compensation was not paid in the manner known to law to the land owners. H DELHI DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. RAJENDER SINGH 9 & ORS. [M. R. SHAH, J.] 3.1 The view taken by the High Court is just contrary to the law A laid down by this Court in the case of Indore Development Authority Vs. Manoharlal and Ors., (2020) 8 SCC 129. In paragraph 366, the Constitution Bench of this Courthas observed and held as under:- “366. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we answer the questions as under: B 366.1. Under the provisions of Section 24(1)(a) in case the award is not made as on 1-1-2014, the date of commencement of the 2013 Act, there is no lapse of proceedings. Compensation has to be determined under the provisions of the 2013 Act. C 366.2. In case the award has been passed within the window period of five years excluding the period covered by an interim of the court, then proceedings shall continue as provided under Section 24(1)(b) of the 2013 Act under the 1894 Act as if it has not been repealed. 366.3. The word “or” used in Section 24(2) between D possession and compensation has to be read as “nor” or as “and”. The deemed lapse of land acquisition proceedings under Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act takes place where due to inaction of authorities for five years or more prior to commencement of the said Act, the possession of land has not been taken nor E compensation has been paid. In other words, in case possession has been taken, compensation has not been paid then there is no lapse. Similarly, if compensation has been paid, possession has not been taken then there is no lapse. 366.4. The expression “paid” in the main part of Section F 24(2) of the 2013 Act does not include a deposit of compensation in court. The consequence of non-deposit is provided in the proviso to Section 24(2) in case it has not been deposited with respect to majority of landholdings then all beneficiaries (landowners) as on the date of notification for land acquisition under Section 4 of the 1894 Act shall be entitled to compensation in accordance with the G provisions of the 2013 Act.
