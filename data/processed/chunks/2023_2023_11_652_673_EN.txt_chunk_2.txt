The present appeal by the State Bank of India (for short “the Bank”), calls in question the correctness of the of the Division Bench of the High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore dated 20.10.2010 in Writ Appeal No. 8085 of 2003. By the said , the Division Bench had dismissed the Appeal of the Bank and confi rmed the and of the learned Single Judge dated 12.11.2003. The learned Single Judge had allowed the Writ Petition No. 29547 of 1997 fi led by the respondent and quashed the passed by the Appointing Authority and granted consequential benefi ts to the respondent. The Appointing Authority had, by its of 31.01.1995, imposed a punishment of “reduction in basic pay to the lowest stage in Scale-I” as envisaged under Rule 49 (e) of the State Bank of India (Supervising Staff ) Service Rules and further, has treated the period spent by the delinquent offi cer under suspension from 18.08.1990 till the date of his reinstatement as suspension only. 656 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. 2. Being aggrieved, the Bank has fi led the present Appeal. Shri Sanjay Kapur, learned counsel for the Bank, contends that the courts below have transgressed the limits of Judicial Review. According to the learned counsel, the courts below have erred in characterizing the s of the Disciplinary authorities as perverse. 3. On the contrary, the respondent represented by Shri S.N. Bhat, learned Senior Counsel, vehemently defends the s impugned. Learned Senior Counsel contends that the present was a case of “no evidence” and the enquiry offi cer without any evidence on record and based only on his personal purported knowledge has recorded the fi ndings of guilt. Learned Senior Counsel further contends that the courts below have rightly set aside the of the Disciplinary Authorities and that the case did not call for any interference.
