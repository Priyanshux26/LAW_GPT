However, in our view, invoking Explanation-2 is neither appropriate nor necessary as sub-clause (ii) of Rule 2(k) itself clearly provides that “input” means all goods, except light diesel oil, high speed diesel oil, motor spirit, commonly known as petrol and motor vehicles, used for providing any output service. Even though tower and the PFBs are not electrical items/equipment in the sense that these do not transmit signals, yet these are indispensable for the effective functioning of antenna by which the radio signals are received and transmitted and accordingly, used for providing the mobile telephonic services to the subscribers. Thus, towers and PFBs, though are not electrical equipment for transmission of signals, yet these are used for transmission of signal by the antennas. Therefore, there can be no denying of the fact that there is a close proximity and nexus between their functioning and the ultimate transmission of radio signals which is the output service rendered by the MSPs. Hence, the view of the CESTAT which has not been disturbed by the Bombay High Court does not commend our acceptance. 11.12.6 Having held that the tower and pre-fabricated buildings (PFBs) are “goods” and not immovable property and since these goods are used for providing mobile telecommunication services, the inescapable conclusion is that they would also qualify as “inputs” under Rule 2(k) for the purpose of credit benefits under the CENVAT Rules. 11.13 For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the conclusions arrived at by the Delhi High Court and uphold the rendered by it in Vodafone (supra) and dismiss the connected appeals being CA No. 5032-5035 of 2021, CA No. 5039-5040 of 2021, CA No. 5038 of 2021, CA No. 5036-5037 of 2021, CA No. 62 of 2022. 11.14 For the same reasons, we are unable to agree with the view of the Bombay High Court and accordingly, set aside the [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1601 M/s Bharti Airtel Ltd. v. The Commissioner of Central Excise, Pune in Bharti Airtel (supra) rendered by it and allow the connected appeals, being CA No. 10409-10 of 2014, CA No. 7119 of 2015, CA No. 7179 of 2015, CA No. 1077 of 2016, CA No. 1078 of 2016, CA No. 5112 of 2021, CA No. 1201 of 2018, CA No. 1205 of 2018, CA No. 1203 of 2018, CA No. 1204 of 2018, CA No. 1202 of 2018, CA No. 5056 of 2021 and CA No. 5832 of 2018. Consequently, all the appeals and connected applications are disposed of in terms of the above findings and conclusions. Result of the case: Appeals disposed of. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey
