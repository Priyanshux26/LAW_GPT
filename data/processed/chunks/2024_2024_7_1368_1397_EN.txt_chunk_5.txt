Further distinguishing the above three cases on which the appellants have placed reliance, it is argued that the appellants in the three above cited cases were working on pensionable post even as per GO 9 [2009] 16 SCR 249 : (2010) 2 SCC 59 10 (1991) 2 UPLBEC1095 11 [1997] Supp. 5 SCR 212 : (1997) 8 SCC 767 1376 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports dated 28.10.1960 whereas none of the appellants in the present batch of appeals have worked on any pensionable post as per the said GO, therefore, the appellants derive no benefit out of the above three cited cases. 16. In respect of the employees appointed after creation of the Corporation w.e.f. 01.06.1972 it is argued that such appellants are not entitled to the benefit of pension on the basis of GO dated 05.07.1972 or the provisions of the Regulations relating to employees of the erstwhile Roadways sent on deputation to the Corporation and thereafter absorbed therein. 17. In respect of the appellants who were appointed subsequent to 01.06.1972 i.e. after creation of the Corporation, the State Government subsequently issued GO dated 20.10.2004 according approval for payment of pension to those employees who had been appointed on pensionable post in the Corporation till 18.06.1981. Therefore, such appellants who were never appointed/worked on pensionable post as per GO dated 28.10.1960 till 18.06.1981, are not entitled to pension. 18. Learned Single Judge of the High Court dismissed the writ petition on the ground of delay and laches; waiver and acquiescence but at the same time proceeded to decide the petitions on merits and after threadbare discussion of the applicable GOs and Regulations rejected the claim on merits. Learned Single Judge distinguished the case of the present batch of the appellants from that of the Mirza Athar Beg (supra), S.M. Fazil (supra) & Narain Pandey (supra). 19. On appeal before the Division Bench, the claim of the appellants was once again dismissed and the passed by the learned Single Judge has been upheld on all material issues including the appellants’ claim on the basis of parity vis-à-vis the earlier cases in the matter of Mirza Athar Beg (supra), S.M. Fazil (supra) & Narain Pandey (supra). ANALYSIS 20. The Roadways was created as a temporary department in 1947. A Government was issued on 16.09.1960 providing service conditions of the Roadways employees. The said GO is reproduced hereunder for ready reference: [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1377 U.P. Roadways Retired Officials and Officers Association v. State of U.P. & Anr. “G.O. No. 3014 D/XXX- 135/59 dated Sept. 16, 1960 Subject: Terms and conditions of service of temporary employees in the U.P. Roadways - Revisions of. I am directed to say that the question of revising the terms and conditions of service of the Roadways employee, which is a nationalized commercial undertaking and has to work in conditions different from those prevailing in regular government offices, has been under the consideration of Government for some time past. The passenger and goods services have to run irrespective of the fact whether it is a Sunday or a festival.
