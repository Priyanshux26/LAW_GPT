Against the aforesaid of the Division Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court, leave was granted by this Court in Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.21988 of 1995 but the Civil Appeal was dismissed as withdrawn by dated 04.05.1999. Before the Madhya Pradesh High Court, in another Writ Petition No.2085 of 1993 – Prakash Mehta vs. ICAI, the validity and legality of the Notification dated 13.01.1989 was challenged. However, the said writ petition was dismissed by the said High Court by its dated 16.05.2005. 3.14 Further, a challenge to Notification dated 13.01.1989 was dismissed by the High Court of Kerala vide dated 25.02.2003 in O.P. No. 3775 of 1991. Dismissing the challenge, it was noted that Section 30(2)(k) of the 1949 Act vests power on the Council to make regulations for regulating and maintaining the status of members of the Institute and standard of professional qualifications of members of the Institute. It was noted that the [2024] 6 S.C.R. 797 Shaji Poulose v. Institute of Chartered Accountants of India & Others restriction therein, as it does here, confined the ceiling limit only to tax audit assignments accepted under Section 44AB and not to any other audit work, unless otherwise restricted under any law. Noting the importance attributed to a certificate of audit issued by a Chartered Accountant and its concomitant serious public interest, it was further noted that audit is a time-bound work demanding precision and that the intent of the restriction was to ensure quality and accuracy in execution. It was further noted that on recommendation of the Professional Development Committee, the Notification had been issued by the Council of Chartered Accountants, which is composed of its members, by its members and for its members. Observing that under Section 15 of the 1949 Act, it is the duty and function of the Council to make provision for regulating and maintaining the status of members of the Institute and that Section 30(2)(k) empowers the Council to frame regulations in that regard, the restriction was held to be reasonable. It is also pertinent to highlight that the s in writ petitions before the Madras High Court and Madhya Pradesh High Court were considered and the latter High Court found itself in disagreement with the Madras High Court on the ground that the restriction had been imposed by a competent statutory body of professionals in the interest of the profession. It was reasoned that no interference was warranted when the statutory body had taken a decision within its powers in the interest of the profession. Against the aforesaid of the High Court of Kerala, Writ Appeal No.1116/2003 was filed before the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court but was dismissed as infructuous on 14.01.2016 on account of the death of the writ petitioner therein. 3.15 At the 184th Meeting of the Council in the year 1997, it considered the issue of certain Chartered Accountants exceeding the prescribed limit and proceeded to refer the matter to the Committee for Ethical Standards and Unjustified Removal of Auditors (CESURA) for a detailed review on the limit of thirty tax audits in a year and also to examine the issue of developing a suitable mechanism for the purpose of monitoring such limit.
