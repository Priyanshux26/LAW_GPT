Remarkably, while the co-accused; Vijay and Pawan Kumar initially participated in the TIP on 20.08.2008, but thereafter all the accused persons including the appellant convict herein refused to participate in the TIP. In their further statements recorded under Section 313 of the CrPC, all of them gave the explanation that they refused to participate as they had already been shown to the witnesses in the police station. Moreover, it is the specifi c case of the appellant convict herein, that he refused the TIP as he was to be identifi ed by PW4 who was a got up witness. 65. Later, on 15.09.2008, the PW 1 and PW 4 who had gone to meet the police offi cials at the Rohini Court complex, identifi ed all the accused persons, who were produced before the Metropolitan Magistrate in connection with the present case. 66. The PW 1 Sushil Kumar in his examination in chief has stated thus:- “I had identifi ed the accused persons on 15.9.2008 in the Rohini Court Complex, when the accused persons were produced in the same Court.” 67. The PW 11 SI Kishan Lal who at the relevant time was posted as Sub-Inspector in the Adarsh Nagar Police Station in his examination in chief as stated thus:- MUKESH SINGH v. THE STATE (NCT OF DELHI) 929 [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] “On 15.9.2008 I alongwith SHO Ram Chander came to the court and there we met PWs Sushil and Pradeep and they had identifi ed all the four accused who were produced in the court for taking the judicial custody. PWs pointed out towards the accused Pawan and Sharwan that they had surrounded Sushil and Pappu and they pointed out towards accused Mukesh and Vijay and told that Mukesh had taken out the money from the pocket of Sushil and Vijay had taken out money from Pappu and they had attacked on them with ice picks on 16.8.2008. IO recorded their statements.” 68. Thus, from the oral evidence of the PW 1 and the PW 11, it is evident that the PW 1 (injured eye witness) had the opportunity to see the accused persons when they were present at the Rohini Court Complex. When the PW 11 says that the witnesses were able to identify all the four accused at the time when they were produced in the court for taking them into judicial custody, the same should be understood as conveying that as an investigating offi cer, he took a chance to get the accused persons identifi ed through the witnesses.
