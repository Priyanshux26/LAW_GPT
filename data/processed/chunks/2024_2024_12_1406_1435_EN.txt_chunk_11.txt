4.3. Grounds to be enumerated in application. While preferring an application under section 52A to any magistrate, emphasis may be laid on “expediency of disposal”. The grounds that may be highlighted may pertain to: (i) Risk of pilferage, theft and substitution; (ii) Constraints of storage and hazardous nature; (iii) High potential and vulnerability of abuse; (iv) High temptations to traffickers; (v) Diminution in the value of other articles (including conveyances) due to long storage, etc.” 17. The Central Government thereafter had issued a Notification dated 16.01.2015 i.e. G.S.R. 38(E) in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 52A, specifying the narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, controlled substances and conveyances to be disposed of, the officers who shall dispose them of and the manner of their disposal. 18. It is very much pertinent to note that the Standing Instructions No. 1 of 88 dated 15.03.1988 and the Standing No. 2 of 88 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1423 Narcotics Control Bureau v. Kashif dated 11.04.1988 issued by the NCB, and the Standing Instructions No. 1 of 89 dated 13.06.1989 and G.S.R. 38(E) dated 16.01.2015 issued by the Central Government, having been issued in exercise of its powers conferred under the Act, had the statutory force and the procedure mentioned therein with regard to the classification, weighing and drawing of samples on the spot of seizure and disposal of the remaining drugs, substances and other articles etc. remained in force and were acted upon all throughout till the Notification dated 23.12.2022 came to be issued by the Central Government, in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 76 read with Section 52A of the said Act. 19. Vide the said Notification, the Rules called “Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Seizure, Storage, Sampling and Disposal) Rules, 2022” came to be published. The said Rules provided for the procedure to be followed for the Seizure and Storage, Sampling, Disposal of the seized material. The Rule 29 of the said Rules, repealed the Standing No. 1 of 88 dated 15.03.1988, Standing No. 2 of 88 dated 11.04.1988 issued by the NCB, and the Standing No.1 of 89 dated 13.06.1989 and the G.S.R. 38(E) issued by the Government of India, alongwith the other Notifications. However, sub-rule (2) of Rule 29 stated that notwithstanding such repeal, anything done or any action taken or purported to have been done or taken under the Standing or notification repealed by sub-rule (1), shall in so far as it is not inconsistent with the provisions of the said Rules, be deemed to have been done or taken under the corresponding provision of the said Rules. 20. Now, so far as Section 52A is concerned, the language employed therein itself is very clear that the said provision was inserted for an early disposal of the seized narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, having regard to the hazardous nature, vulnerability to theft, substitution, constraints of proper storage space and other relevant considerations. Apart from the plain language used in the said section, its Heading also makes it clear that the said provision was inserted for the Disposal of the seized narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.
