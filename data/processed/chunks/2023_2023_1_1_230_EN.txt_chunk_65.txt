As already discussed herein above, in our considered view, the legislative intent could not have been to give a restricted meaning to the word “any” in sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act. 158. We are, therefore, unable to accept the contention that the B word “any” has to be given a restricted meaning taking into consideration the overall scheme, purpose and the object of the RBI Act and also the context in which the power is to be exercised. We find that the word “any” would mean “all” under sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act. C ISSUE NO. (ii): IN THE EVENT IT IS HELD THAT THE POWER UNDER SUB-SECTION (2) OF SECTION 26 OF THE RBI ACT IS CONSTRUED TO MEAN THAT IT CAN BE EXERCISED IN RESPECT OF “ALL” SERIES OF BANK NOTES, WHETHER THE POWER VESTED WITH THE D CENTRAL GOVERNMENT UNDER THE SAID SUB-SECTION WOULD AMOUNT TO CONFERRING EXCESSIVE DELEGATION AND AS SUCH, LIABLE TO BE STRUCK DOWN? 159. The second limb of argument on behalf of the petitioners is E that, if the word “any” used in sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act is not given a restricted meaning, then sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act will have to be held invalid on the ground that it confers excessive delegation upon the Central Government. 160. It is submitted that sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the RBI Act vests uncanalised, unguided and arbitrary powers in the Central F Government and as such, on this ground alone, the said provision is liable to be struck down. 161. Shri P. Chidambaram, learned Senior Counsel has relied on the Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of Hamdard Dawakhana (Wakf) Lal Kuan, Delhi and another (supra) to buttress G his submissions. Precedents considering delegated legislation 162. In the case of Hamdard Dawakhana (Wakf) Lal Kuan, Delhi and another (supra), the Constitution Bench of this Court while H 88 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A considering the validity of clause (d) of Section 3 of the Drug and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisement) Act, (21 of 1954) observed thus: “33. The interdiction under the Act is applicable to conditions and diseases set out in the various clauses of Section 3 and to those B that may under the last part of clause (d) be specified in the Rules made under Section 16. The first sub-section of Section 16 authorises the making of rules to carry out the purposes of the Act and clause (a) of sub-section (2) of that section specifically authorises the specification of diseases or conditions to which the provisions of Section 3 shall apply. It is the first sub-section of C Section 16 which confers the general rule-making power i.e. it delegates to the administrative authority the power to frame rules and regulations to subserve the object and purpose of the Act. Clause (a) of the second sub-section is merely illustrative of the power given under the first sub-section; King- D Emperor v. Sibnath Banerji [(1945) LR 72 IA 241] .
