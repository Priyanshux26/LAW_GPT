State of Bihar v. Mohd. Kalimuddin4: “ 8. As held in the case of Shankarsan Dash [(1991) 3 SCC 47 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 800 : (1991) 17 ATC 95 : (1991) 2 2 [2006] Supp. 7 SCR 755 : (2006) 8 SCC 686, Para 17 3 [2009] 1 SCR 585 : (2009) 2 SCC 706 at 709, Para 16 4 [1996] 1 SCR 314 : (1996) 2 SCC 7 at 12. Paras 8 & 9 946 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports SCR 567] even if vacancies are notified for appointment and adequate number of candidates are found fit, the successful candidates do not acquire an indefeasible right to be appointed, unless the relevant rules indicate to the contrary. It is indeed expected of the State to act bona fide and for valid reasons in refusing to make the appointments after the selection process has been gone through…….. Without knowing the nature of change it was not open to the High Court to anticipate the policy and brand it as unreasonable. 9. For the above reasons, we are of the opinion that even if it is assumed that the panel or select list had not expired at the date of filing of the writ petition, the refusal on the part of the Government to make appointments from the panel or select list, vide letter dated 27-5-1993, could not be condemned as arbitrary, irrational and or mala fide. We, therefore, reverse the view taken by the High Court, set it aside and hold that the original writ petition was liable to be dismissed and we hereby dismiss the same. No as to costs.” 25. The opinion expressed in the above s makes it clear that a panel or a Merit List cannot be treated as if it exists in perpetuity, which will facilitate making appointments as and when required. When the panel expires or after the selection process is over with most posts being filled, the benefit of appointments cannot be given unless the panel’s validity is legally extended. However, no such extension of the panel’s validity was granted. In fact, in conclusion of the earlier process, a fresh recruitment process was undertaken vide Notification dated 29.09.2022, through which, 9500 candidates have already been appointed. 26. That apart even when vacancies are notified and an adequate number of candidates are shortlisted, these candidates do not acquire an indefeasible right to be appointed against those vacancies. Multiple factors are to be taken into account by the Board, including suitability as per district, age, language, etc. before appointments are made. For such reasons 3929 vacancies remained unfilled by the time the panel’s validity expired. Before that, 12,571 appointments were made. [2024] 5 S.C.R. 947 Ali Hossain Mandal & Ors. v. West Bengal Board of Primary Education & Ors. 27. As earlier noted, the selection process for appointment to the posts of primary teacher is to be made by assessment of merit by the Selection Committee as notified under Rule 8 of the Recruitment Rules, 2016.
