B. PARDIWALA, J.] Court in the above case emphasised that the debate on Section 167 must A also be looked at from the perspective of expeditious conclusion of investigation and from the angle of personal liberty. This Court also held that the right of default bail is an indefeasible right which cannot be allowed to be frustrated by the prosecution. Following was laid down in paras 37, 38 and 39: B “37. This Court had occasion to review the entire case law on the subject in Union of India v. Nirala Yadav [Union of India v. Nirala Yadav, (2014) 9 SCC 457 : (2014) 5 SCC (Cri) 212] . In that decision, reference was made to Uday Mohanlal Acharya v. State of Maharashtra [Uday Mohanlal C Acharya v. State of Maharashtra, (2001) 5 SCC 453 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 760] and the conclusions arrived at in that decision. We are concerned with Conclusion (3) which reads as follows : (Uday Mohanlal Acharya case [Uday Mohanlal Acharya v. State of Maharashtra, (2001) 5 SCC 453 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 760] , SCC p. 473, para 13) D “13. … (3) On the expiry of the said period of 90 days or 60 days, as the case may be, an indefeasible right accrues in favour of the accused for being released on bail on account of default by the investigating agency in the completion of the investigation within the period prescribed E and the accused is entitled to be released on bail, if he is prepared to and furnishes the bail as directed by the Magistrate.” 38. This Court also dealt with the decision rendered in Sanjay Dutt [Sanjay Dutt v. State, (1994) 5 SCC 410 : 1994 SCC (Cri) F 1433] and noted that the principle laid down by the Constitution Bench is to the effect that if the charge-sheet is not filed and the right for “default bail” has ripened into the status of indefeasibility, it cannot be frustrated by the prosecution on any pretext. The accused can avail his liberty G by filing an application stating that the statutory period for filing the charge-sheet or challan has expired and the same has not yet been filed and therefore the indefeasible right has accrued in his or her favour and further the accused is prepared to furnish the bail bond. H 24 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A 39. This Court also noted that apart from the possibility of the prosecution frustrating the indefeasible right, there are occasions when even the court frustrates the indefeasible right. Reference was made to Mohd. Iqbal Madar Sheikh v. State of Maharashtra [Mohd. Iqbal Madar Sheikh v. State of Maharashtra, (1996) 1 SCC 722 : 1996 B SCC (Cri) 202] wherein it was observed that some courts keep the application for “default bail” pending for some days so that in the meantime a charge-sheet is submitted. While such a practice both on the part of the prosecution as well as some courts must be very strongly and vehemently discouraged, C we reiterate that no subterfuge should be resorted to, to defeat the indefeasible right of the accused for “default bail” during the interregnum when the statutory period for filing the charge-sheet or challan expires and the submission of the charge-sheet or challan in court.” D 30.One more of this Court on Section 167 of the CrPC be noticed i.e., Achpal alias Ramswaroop and Another v. State of Rajasthan, reported in (2019) 14 SCC 599.
