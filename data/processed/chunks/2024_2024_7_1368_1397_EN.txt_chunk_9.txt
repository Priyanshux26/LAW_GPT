23. The State Government felt it necessary to evolve a new set of service conditions considering the nature of duties and functions of the Roadways. In the above quoted GO dated 28.10.1960, the State Government considered and declared some permanent gazetted and non-gazetted posts of the Roadways to be entitled for pension. Clauses (2) & (3) of GO dated 28.10.1960 clearly provided that only those covered in clause (1) of the GO would be entitled to pension whereas the rest of the permanent non-gazetted employees both in the traffic and engineering sections of the Roadways would be treated as non-pensionable posts and will be eligible for provident fund benefits in accordance with the provisions of the Employees Provident Fund Act. This provision made a specific reference to Note 3 of Article 350 of the Regulations. 24. It was also provided that temporary employment of the categories mentioned in para 1 will be entitled to provident fund. However, as and when they became permanent, they will have the option to elect the contributory provident fund cum pension benefits in lieu of employees’ provident fund. In yet another circular dated 21.04.1961, it was again clarified that the posts mentioned in clause (1) of GO dated 28.10.1960 should be treated as pensionable and those temporary employees falling in the said clause shall also be treated as pensionable from the date they were converted into permanent post. 25. The Corporation was constituted under Section 3 of the Act, 1950 w.e.f. 01.06.1972. By GO dated 07.06.1972 all the employees of the erstwhile Roadways holding permanent posts as per GO dated 28.10.1960 were declared entitled for pension except the following: (i) Those working on daily wages; (ii) Those appointed on ad-hoc basis; (iii) Those who had not completed minimum service period prescribed for the post; (iv) Those holding posts which were not declared pensionable; [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1383 U.P.
