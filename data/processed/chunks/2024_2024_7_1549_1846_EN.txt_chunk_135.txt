282. The principle which emanates from Western Coalfield Ltd (supra) is that the legislative declaration under the MMDR Act will only affect 354 [1982] 2 SCR 1 : (1982) 1 SCC 125 355 “Coal Mines Act” 356 Western Coalfields Ltd (supra) [28] [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1721 Mineral Area Development Authority & Anr. v. M/s Steel Authority of India & Anr. Etc. the legislative power of the State with respect to Entry 23 of List II to the extent the Parliamentary legislation covers the subject-matter. The legislative powers of the State with respect to other subjects under List II, including taxes on lands and buildings, will not be affected or controlled by the MMDR Act. Therefore, the legislative powers of the States to levy a tax falling under Entry 49 of List II remains unaffected. iii. Measure of tax 283. Among its elements a tax has to provide for the charge of tax, the incidence of tax, the measure of the tax and will contain provisions in the nature of the machinery for assessment and recovery. In Rai Ramkrishna v. State of Bihar,357 a Constitution Bench of this Court observed as follows: “12. […] The objects to be taxed so long as they happen to be within the legislative competence of the legislature can be taxed by the legislature according to the exigencies of its needs, because there can be no doubt that the State is entitled to raise revenue by taxation. The quantum of tax levied by the taxing statute, the conditions subject to which it is levied, the manner in which it is sought to be recovered, are all matters within the competence of the legislature, […]” 284. It now a well-settled principle that the determination of the principles for assessing the amount of tax is within the legislative domain.358 The quantification or measurement of liability is done on the basis of the procedures laid down by the competent legislature.359 In situations where the legislature selects one method out of the many available for assessing tax, the courts should not strike down the levy on the ground that the legislature should have adopted another method unless the method is capricious, fanciful, arbitrary or clearly unjust.360 Although the liability may be quantified or measured in many ways, there is a clear distinction between the subject matter of a tax and the standard by which the amount of tax is measured. 357 [1964] 1 SCR 897 : (1963) SCC OnLine SC 31 358 S Kodar v. State of Kerala (1974) 4 SCC 422 [10] 359 Shaktikumar M Sancheti v. State of Maharashtra (1995) 1 SCC 351 [3] 360 Khandige Sham Bhat v. Agricultural Income Tax Officer, Kasargod, 1962 SCC OnLine SC 15 [10] 1722 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 285. The pith and substance or true nature and character of the legislation must be determined with reference to the legislative subject matter and the charging section.361 The charging section levying a tax and defining the persons who are liable to pay the tax constitute the core of a taxing statute.362 The distinction between the nature of tax and measure of tax can be gathered from the decision of this Court in Sainik Motors, Jodhpur v. State of Rajasthan.363 In that case, the petitioners challenged the levy of taxes on passengers and goods by the State legislature.
