Unless the discipline of adhering to decisions made by the higher authorities is maintained, there would be utter chaos in administration of tax C laws apart from undue harassment to assesses. [Para 34][890-B- D] 1.7 The submission that suo motu power of revision, on the terms of section 34, could have been exercised only if the s sought to be revised suffered from any illegality or D impropriety, is accepted. [Para 36][890-F-G] 1.8 A decision may be questioned as suffering from an illegality if its maker fails to understand the law that regulates his decision making power correctly or if he fails to give effect to any law that holds the field and binds the parties. On the other E hand, having regard to the purpose section 34 seeks to serve, to take exception to a decision on the ground of lack of propriety of any proceedings or passed in such proceedings, it essentially ought to relate to a procedural impropriety. It is incumbent for the accuser to show that the decision maker has F failed to observe the standard procedures applicable in case of exercise of his power. Additionally, to impeach an on the ground of moral impropriety, it has to be shown that the weight of facts together with the applicable law overwhelmingly points to one course of action but the decision has surprisingly gone the other way, giving reason to suspect misbehaviour or misconduct G in the sphere of activity of the decision maker warranting a revision. [Para 37][890-G-H; 891-A-B] 1.9. There is nothing on record to justify either illegality or (procedural/moral) impropriety in the proceedings before the Assessing Authority or the s passed by him, as such. The H 876 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A Assessing Authority was bound by the of the tribunal and elected to follow it having no other option. Such decision of the tribunal was even binding on the Revisional Authority. In such circumstances, to brand the s of the Assessing Authority as suffering from illegality and impropriety appears to be not only unjustified but also demonstrates thorough lack of understanding B of the principle regulating exercise of suo motu revisional power by a quasi-judicial authority apart from being in breach of the principle of judicial discipline, while confronted with s passed by a superior tribunal/Court. It is not the Assessing Authority’s s but those passed by the Revisional Authority, which suffer C from a patent illegality. [Para 38][891-C-E] 1.10 The impugned final revisional s dated 2nd March, 2009 for the Assessment Years 2003-04 and 2004-05 is invalidated.
