An instrument whether unstamped or insuffi ciently stamped will not fall foul on the ground of consideration or object of the agreement being immoral, neither will it fall foul as opposed to public policy. 37. In B.O.I. Finance Ltd. v. Custodian and Others48 this Court after examining the case law on the subject of public policy, observed that in pursuant to an agreement to do an illegal act, a transaction, in part, takes place which would otherwise be valid if there was no such prior agreement, then notwithstanding the illegality of the contract, the completed transaction itself cannot be regarded as invalid. 38. Following this , in Canara Bank and Others v. Standard Chartered Bank49, it is held that for the contract to be declared void on the ground of public policy, it must be shown that the object and consideration of the contract was one which was illegal. Where the object and consideration of the contract is not illegal as in the case of sale/ purchase of securities and payment of price, the contract will not be void on the ground of being opposed to public policy. The contention that the performance of contract in violation of law will be void on ground of public policy was rejected. These observations were made in the context of the argument that there was violation of law while carrying out the contract and the arrangement was opposed to public policy. 39. A by Mr. Justice S.S. Nijjar in Swiss Timing Ltd. v. Commonwealth Games 2010 Organising Committee50, has elaborately dealt with the terms ‘void’ and ‘voidable’ and states that they are used loosely and interchangeably with each other, though strictly in law, they are not so. It is also important to draw a distinction between contracts which are void, and those which are void ab initio due to lack of elements of off er or acceptance, which prevents a contract from coming into operation. Thus, a contract by a minor or by a person of unsound mind would be void due to lack of eff ectual off er or acceptance. But once the contract is made, that is to say where parties, whatever their innermost state of mind, have to all 48 (1997) 10 SCC 488. 49 (2002) 10 SCC 697. 50 (2014) 6 SCC 677.
