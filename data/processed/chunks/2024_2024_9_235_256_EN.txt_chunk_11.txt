Lexus Technologies Pvt. Ltd. and other Companies Act, 1956, with effect from 31.05.1991 and 20.09.1995 respectively. These provisions corresponded to erstwhile Section 155. Presently, Section 59 of the Act of 2013 and Rule 70(5) of the National Company Law Tribunal Rules, 2016, deal with rectification. Rule 70(5) is in pari materia with Section 111(7) of the Companies Act, 1956. 24. In Ammonia Supplies Corporation (P) Ltd. vs. Modern Plastic Containers Pvt. Ltd. and others,1 the short question for consideration was framed thus by this Court: ‘Whether in the proceedings under Section 155 of the Companies Act, 1956, the Court has exclusive jurisdiction in respect of all the matters raised therein or has only summary jurisdiction?’ It was observed that the very word ‘rectification’ in Section 155 of the Companies Act, 1956, connotes something that ought to have been done but by error was not done or ought not to have been done but was done, requiring correction. It was held that the Court has discretion to find out whether the dispute raised is really for rectification or is of such a nature that, unless decided first, it would not come within the purview of rectification. It was further held that, if it is truly a case of rectification, all matters raised in that connection should be decided under Section 155, but if it finds adjudication of any matter not falling under it, the Court may direct a party to get his right adjudicated by a civil court. Noting that there was nothing in the Companies Act, 1956, expressly barring the jurisdiction of the civil court, it was observed that where the ‘Court’ as defined under the Act is exercising its powers under various sections, where it has been vested with exclusive jurisdiction, the jurisdiction of the civil court is impliedly barred. It was, therefore, held that to the extent the ‘Court’ has exclusive jurisdiction under Section 155, the jurisdiction of the civil court is impliedly barred. But for what is not covered as aforesaid, the civil court would have jurisdiction. Noting that the jurisdiction of the ‘Court’ under Section 155 is summary in nature, it was held that it would be appropriate for the ‘Court’ to see for itself whether any document alleged to be forged is said to be so, only to exclude the jurisdiction of the ‘Court’ or it is genuinely so. As the High Court, exercising jurisdiction under Section 155 of the Companies Act, 1956, had not examined the case in this light, this Court remanded the matter to the High Court for decision afresh. 1 [1998] Supp. 1 SCR 413 : (1998) 7 SCC 105 250 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports The observations in paragraph 26 of the are of relevance in this regard and are extracted below: “26. The proviso gave discretion to the court to direct an issue of law to be tried, if raised. By this deletion, submission is that the Company Court now itself has to decide any question relating to the rectification of the Register including the law and not to send one to the civil court.
