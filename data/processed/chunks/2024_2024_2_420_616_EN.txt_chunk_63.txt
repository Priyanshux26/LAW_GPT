They argue that the purpose of curbing of black money cannot be traced to any of the grounds in Article 19(2), and thus, is not a legitimate purpose for restricting the right to information. 110. Article 19(2) stipulates that the right to freedom of speech and expression can only be restricted on the grounds of: (a) the sovereignty and integrity of India; (b) the security of the State; (c) friendly relations with foreign states, (d) public ; (e) decency 125 See Media One v. Union of India, Civil Appeal No. 8129 of 2022 [77-79] [2024] 2 S.C.R. 508 Digital Supreme Court Reports or morality; (f) contempt of court; (g) defamation; and (h) incitement to an offence. The purpose of curbing black money is traceable to public interest. However, public interest is not one of the grounds stipulated in Article 19(2). Of the rights recognized under Article 19, only Article 19(1)(g) which guarantees the freedom to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business can be restricted on the ground of public interest.7 7 111. In Sakal Papers v. The Union of India’‘”’, the constitutional validity of the Newspaper (Price and Page) Act 1965 and the Daily Newspaper (Price and Page) 1960 which regulated the number of pages according to the price charged, prescribed the number of supplements to be published and regulated the area for advertisements in the newspapers was challenged on the ground that it violated the freedom of press under Article 19(1)(a). The Union of India submitted that the restriction on the freedom of press was justified because the purpose of the law was to prevent unfair competition which was in furtherance of public interest. It was argued that the restriction was justified because the activities carried out by newspapers were also traceable to the freedom to carry out a profession which could be restricted on the ground of public interest under Article 19(6). Justice JR Mudholkar writing for the Constitution Bench observed that the impugned legislation “directly and immediately” curtails the freedom of speech guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a), and the freedom cannot be restricted on any ground other than the grounds stipulated in Article 19(2).

Uenionr ofs In dia,’ a Constitution Bench while deciding the constitutional challenge to the Working Journalists (Conditions of Service) and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1955 held that a law violating Article 19(1)(a) would be unconstitutional unless the purpose of the law falls “squarely within the provisions of Article 19(2)”.
