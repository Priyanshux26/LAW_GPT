However, subsequently by Notifi cation No.10/2003 – CE (NT) dated 01.03.2003 was issued introducing Entry 24A in Notifi cation 13/2002 dated 1.03.2002, thereby covering all goods under entry 2404.41 within the ambit of ‘notifi ed goods’ for the purposes of Section 4A of the CE Act. 588 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. 14. Prior to the introduction of the 8-digit tariff classifi cation, ‘chewing tobacco’ was refl ected under Chapter 24, under specifi c entry ‘2404.41’ of the six-digit Central Excise Tariff classifi cation. Subsequently the new 8-digit Central Excise Tariff classifi cation was introduced vide Circular 808/05/2005 -CX dated 25.02.2005, Chapter 24 of the Central Excise Tarriff came to be amended and heading ‘2403’ was introduced which reads: “2403 – Other manufactured tobacco and manufactured tobacco substitutes; ‘Homogenised’ or ‘Reconstituted’ tobacco; Tobacco extracts and essences”. The Central Excise Tariff Heading ‘2403’ included the following sub-headings: “2403 9910 chewing tobacco 2403 9920 preparations containing chewing tobacco. 2403 9930 zarda/jarda scented tobacco.” 15. On 01.03.2006, Notifi cation No.2/2006 was issued, vide which Notifi cation No.13/2002 dated 01.03.2002 was superseded. Thus, the list of products, with their respective chapter headings/sub-headings, which were to be covered under the assessment in terms of Section 4A of the CE Act, were notifi ed in terms of the eight-digit tariff classifi cation. However, it is pertinent to note that said Notifi cation No.2/2006 did not include ‘Jarda/ Zarda scented tobacco – CET SH 2403 9930’ within the scope of ‘notifi ed goods’ under Section 4A of the CE Act, for availing the benefi ts of abatement as percentage of retail sale price. 16. Subsequently, Notifi cation No.16 of 2006 dated 11.07.2006 was issued, wherein CET SH 2403 9930 came to be included within Notifi cation No.2/2006 dated 01.03.2006, thereby including ‘jarda/ zarda scented tobacco’ within the scope of ‘notifi ed goods’ under Section 4A of CE Act. 17. It is relevant to note at this juncture, the period between 1.03.2006 and 11.07.2006, during which the benefi ts of MRP-based assessment was not available to goods classifi ed under CET SH 2403 9930 as ‘jarda/ zarda scented tobacco’ is the very same period of dispute which has to be adjudicated in the appeals in Group I (Urmin Products) and Group II (Flakes-n-fl avourz). COMMR. OF CEN. EXC. AHMEDABAD v. M/S URMIN 589 PRODUCTS P. LTD. AND OTHERS [ARAVIND KUMAR, J.] 18.
