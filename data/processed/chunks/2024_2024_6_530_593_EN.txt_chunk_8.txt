11. The candidates must secure at least 10 marks out of 50 marks in the interview. 12. The candidate must pass both the written test and interview before he is considered for appointment.” 4.2. With the above prescription of marks, the advertisement No. 1/2015 was issued in January 2015 by the Patna High Court to fill up 99 vacancies in the Bihar Superior Judicial Service. The advertisement provided in clauses 6(d) and (e) that the candidates will have to secure at least 10 out of 50 marks, in the interview segment. 4.3. Responding to the above advertisement in January 2015, around 6771 candidates appeared in the preliminary 542 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports examination held on 22.03.2015. Those securing 176 marks or more in the screening test were cleared to participate in the main examination. Some unsuccessful candidates had filed writ petitions before the High Court alleging discrepancies in the framing of questions and revised model answers. Eventually, on the High Court’s interim , those with a reduced score of 173 or more marks in the screening test were also “provisionally” allowed to write the main examination. The main written test was held on 12.7.2015 where around 1000 candidates (qualifying in the preliminary examination) appeared. 4.4. However, only 3 candidates were found to have obtained the qualifying marks i.e. above 55 % in the written examination. Accordingly, the five Judges of the Selection and Appointment Committee of the Patna High Court proposed moderation of marks in their meeting dated 8.1.2016. This led to adding of 4% marks in paper 1 and 6% marks in paper 2 in the respective scores of the individual candidates. 4.5. Despite the above moderation exercise, very few candidates could secure the notified 55% marks in aggregate. To address the issue, the Selection and Appointment Committee permitted a relaxation of 5% in the aggregate in the meeting held on 13.1.2016 by exercising options under the proviso to Clause 10 of Appendix – ‘C’ of the Bihar Rules 1951. The Full Court endorsed the relaxation of aggregate marks at 50% in the written test. With this, 81 candidates who had scored 50% in the written test qualified for the interview, and their results were declared on 22.1.2016. 4.6. In the meantime, the Patna High Court on 8.1.2016 dismissed the Writ Petition (CWJC No.11731/2015) of candidates who were earlier allowed by way of an ad-interim , to appear in the main written exam with the declaration that candidates who had secured less than 176 marks in the screening test, are ineligible to take part in the main examination. Accordingly, 5 such candidates who scored less than 176 marks were disqualified on 1.2.2016. During the verification process, 3 other shortlisted candidates were found to be not practicing as lawyers and were thus found ineligible. Finally, 69 candidates were cleared for the interview which was conducted in February [2024] 6 S.C.R. 543 Abhimeet Sinha & Ors. v. High Court of Judicature at Patna & Ors. 2016, by a Committee of 5 Judges of the High Court.
