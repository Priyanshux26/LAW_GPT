In the said case, it was argued before a three-Judge Bench of this Court that Section 18-A inserted by way of amendment was only with a view to nullify the of this Court in Subhash Kashinath (supra) referred to above. This Court noted that it was not in dispute that the bar of Section 18-A in the Act, 1989 had been enacted because of the passed by this Court in Subhash Kashinath (supra) more particularly in view of the directions contained in paragraphs 79.3 and 79.5 therein. The court also noted that the review petitions filed by the Union of India in Subhash Kashinath (supra) were allowed and the directions contained in paragraphs 79.3 to 79.5 referred to above were ed to be recalled. 33. In such circumstances, this Court observed that the examination of the Constitutional validity of Section 18-A brought by way of the amendment had been rendered academic. However, the Bench proceeded to look into the matter. Justice Arun Mishra, speaking for himself and Justice Vineet Saran held as under: “10. Section 18-A(i) was inserted owing to the decision of this Court in Subhash Kashinath [Subhash Kashinath Mahajan v. State of Maharashtra (2018) 6 SCC 454 : (2018) 1122 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 3 SCC (Cri) 124], which made it necessary to obtain the approval of the appointing authority concerning a public servant and the SSP in the case of arrest of accused persons. This Court has also recalled that direction on Review Petition (Crl.) No. 228 of 2018 decided on 1-10-2019 [Union of India v. State of Maharashtra (2020) 4 SCC 761] . Thus, the provisions which have been made in Section 18-A are rendered of academic use as they were enacted to take care of mandate issued in Subhash Kashinath [Subhash Kashinath Mahajan v. State of Maharashtra (2018) 6 SCC 454 : (2018) 3 SCC (Cri) 124] which no more prevails. The provisions were already in Section 18 of the Act with respect to anticipatory bail. 11. Concerning the applicability of provisions of Section 438 CrPC, it shall not apply to the cases under the 1989 Act. However, if the complaint does not make out a prima facie case for applicability of the provisions of the 1989 Act, the bar created by Sections 18 and 18-A(i) shall not apply. We have clarified this aspect while deciding the review petitions. 12. The Court can, in exceptional cases, exercise power under Section 482 CrPC for quashing the cases to prevent misuse of provisions on settled parameters, as already observed while deciding the review petitions. The legal position is clear, and no argument to the contrary has been raised. 13. The challenge to the provisions has been rendered academic. In view of the aforesaid clarifications, we dispose of the petitions.” 34. Justice S. Ravindra Bhat, while concurring with the rendered by Justice Mishra, assigned his own reasons which are reproduced hereinbelow: “32. As far as the provision of Section 18-A and anticipatory bail is concerned, the of Mishra, J. has stated that in cases where no prima facie materials exist warranting arrest in a complaint, the court has the inherent power to direct a pre-arrest bail.
