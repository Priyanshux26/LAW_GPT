41. With the above understanding, let us now examine the contention that the s in Hemani Malhotra v. High Court of Delhi19(for short “Hemani Malhotra”), and Ramesh Kumar v. High Court of Delhi20 (for short “Ramesh Kumar”), are authorities for the proposition that there can be no minimum marks for viva voce since the recommendations of the Shetty Commission were accepted in All India Judges (2002). Mr. Rishabh Sancheti, the learned counsel for the writ petitioners 17 Dr. Kavita Khamboj v High Court of Punjab and Haryana, 2024 SCC OnLine SC 254 18 Sivananda CT v High Court of Kerala (2024) 3 SCC 799 19 [2008] 5 SCR 1066 : (2008) 7 SCC 11 20 [2010] 2 SCR 256 : (2010) 3 SCC 104 564 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports would additionally argue that the in Mahinder Kumar (supra) is per incuriam because despite being a subsequent decision, it does not refer or consider the earlier relevant observations in Ramesh Kumar (supra). Mr. Pawanshree Agarwal, the learned counsel would submit that there is a dichotomy between the decisions in Mahender Kumar (supra) and Ramesh Kumar (supra). While Mahender Kumar (supra) endorses the Shetty Commission recommendations to be a guideline, Ramesh Kumar (supra) notes that the recommendations were accepted by this Court in All India Judges (2002). 42. The learned counsel for the writ petitioners have relied on the following paragraph from Hemani Malhotra (supra): “18. This Court notices that in All India Judges’ Assn. v. Union of India [(2002) 4 SCC 247 : 2002 SCC (L&S) 508] subject to the various modifications indicated in the said decision, the other recommendations of the Shetty Commission were accepted by this Court. It means that prescription of cut-off marks at viva voce test by the respondent was not in accordance with the decision of this Court. It is an admitted position that both the petitioners had cleared written examination and therefore after adding marks obtained by them in the written examination to the marks obtained in the viva voce test, the result of the petitioners should have been declared. As noticed earlier 16 vacant posts were notified to be filled up and only five candidates had cleared the written test. Therefore, if the marks obtained by the petitioners at viva voce test had been added to the marks obtained by them in the written test then the names of the petitioners would have found place in the merit list prepared by the respondent. Under the circumstances, this Court is of the opinion that the petitions filed by the petitioners will have to be accepted in part.” 43. The factual backdrop of the aforementioned case was that there was no prescription of minimum cut-off marks or viva voce in the Delhi Higher Judicial Service Examination, 2006. Therefore, the issue before the Court was whether the introduction of the requirement of minimum marks for interview, after the selection process was completed, would amount to changing the rules of the game after the game was played.
