office or bureau for the granting of licences may be very small and the amount of imposition that is levied is based really not upon the costs incurred by the Government but upon the benefit that the individual receives. In such cases, according to all the writers on public finance, the tax element is predominant, and if the money paid by the licence-holders goes for the upkeep of roads and other matters of general public utility, the licence fee cannot but be regarded as a tax” In Shirur Mutt (supra), it was held that a fee is money taken by the Government “as the return for the work done or services rendered.”48 Therefore, a fee was characterised by an element of quid pro quo between the payer and the public authority. 36. In a series of subsequent decisions, this Court held that a levy can be regarded as a fee if it has a “reasonable relationship” with services rendered by the public authority.49 The traditional view that there must be an actual quid pro quo for a fee has not been applied in the strict sense in subsequent decisions of this Court. It has been held that the relationship between the levy of a fee and services rendered is one of general character and not of mathematical exactitude.50 37. In Corporation of Calcutta v. Liberty Cinema,51 a Constitution Bench observed that licence fees are not necessarily charged in return for services rendered. This Court referred to a Privy Council decision52 which inter alia held that licence fees could be charged to defray the costs of administering the local regulations. In Secunderabad Hyderabad Hotel Owners’ Association v. Hyderabad Municipal 48 Shirur Mutt (supra) [48] 49 H H Sudhindra Thirtha Swamiar v. Commissioner for Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments, [1963] Supp. 2 SCR 302 [18]. [It was observed: “18. […] A levy in the nature of a fee does no cease to be of that character merely because there is an element of compulsion or coerciveness present in it, not is it a postulate of a fee that it must have direct relation to the actual services rendered by the authority to each individual who obtains the benefit of service. If with a view to provide a specific service, levy is imposed by law and expenses for maintaining the service are met out of the amounts collected there being a reasonable relation between the levy and the expenses incurred for rendering the service, the levy would be in the nature of a fee and not in the nature of a tax.”]; Indian Mica Micanite Industries v.
