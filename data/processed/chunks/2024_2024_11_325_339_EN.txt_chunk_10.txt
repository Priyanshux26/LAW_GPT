5 [2022] 11 SCR 1136 : 2022 SCC OnLine SC 554 [2024] 11 S.C.R. 339 Anoop M. and Others v. Gireeshkumar T.M. and Others Etc. 27. We, therefore, have no hesitation in placing the blame for this entire imbroglio on the KPSC as it laid the genesis for this litigation owing to its changing stances at different points of time. A State instrumentality seized of the solemn responsibility of making selections to public services must maintain a high standard of probity and transparency and is not expected to remain nebulous as to its norms or resort to falsehoods before the Court, contrary to what it had stated in its earlier sworn affidavits. We can only hope that the Kerala Public Service Commission learns from this experience and desists, at least in future, from trifling with the lives, hopes and aspirations of candidates who seek public employment. 28. On the above analysis, we hold that no error was committed by the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in confirming the view taken by the learned Judge, non-suiting candidates with DCA/higher qualifications who aspired for selection to the post of Lower Division Clerk in the Kerala Water Authority. The appeals are accordingly dismissed. Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of. Parties shall bear their own costs. Result of the case: Appeals dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
