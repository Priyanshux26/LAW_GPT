Digital Supreme Court Reports 12 11061 RAJESH KUMAR BAGGA 13 10587 NARANJAN SINGH Registrar General is directed to upload the names of above mentioned 13 successful candidates to the official website of this Court. 10. This Resolution has been disclosed in the reply to the Rejoinder affidavit filed on behalf of the High Court of Jharkhand, affirmed by Registrar General of that Court. 11. There are two impleadment applications registered as I.A. No. 173928 of 2023 taken out by ‘Purnendu Sharan’ and I.A. No. 10383 of 2024 taken out by ‘Ashutosh Kumar Pandey’, both of them being aggrieved by the procedure adopted by the Full Court. 12. Another set of candidates have filed the second writ petition registered as Writ Petition (Civil) No. 921 of 2023. In this writ petition, altogether five candidates have sought substantially the same relief asked for in the Writ Petition (Civil) No. 753 of 2023. 13. The petitioners have been represented before us by Mr. Dushyant Dave, Mr. Vinay Navare and Mr. Jayant K. Sud, learned senior counsel whereas the High Court of Jharkhand has been represented by Mr. Jaideep Gupta, learned senior counsel. Mr. Rajiv Shanker Dvivedi, learned Standing Counsel for the State of Jharkhand has appeared for the State. State has taken a non-committal stand before us. Counter affidavit has been filed by the State in which also no definitive stand has been taken on the legality of the Resolution in the Full Court meeting of the High Court. It has however been submitted by the State that certain amendments need to be carried out in Rule 21 of the 2001 Rules. That plea does not come within the scope of the present proceedings. 14. The petitioners’ main case rests on two planks. First one is that the decision of the Full Court on the administrative side goes contrary to the Recruitment Rules, Regulations and the Terms contained in the advertisement. The second plank of the submissions advanced by the petitioners is that in any event, after the performance of each of the candidate is known and the marks obtained by them in the two forms of the examination are disclosed, it was impermissible for the High Court Administration to introduce fresh cut-off marks. On this point, the authority relied upon by Mr. Dave is a of a Constitution Bench comprising of five Hon’ble Judges of this [2024] 2 S.C.R. 227 Sushil Kumar Pandey & Ors. v. The High Court of Jharkhand & Anr. Court in the case of Sivanandan C.T. & Ors. Vs. High Court of Kerala [(2023) INSC 709)] decided on 12th July, 2023. This narrates the factual background of that case in paragraph ‘7’ thereof and the ratio of this decision would emerge from paragraphs ‘52’ to ‘57’ of the said .
