It is settled principle of law that the High Court can exercise jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC even when the discharge application is pending with the trial court. Indeed, it would be a travesty to hold that proceedings initiated against a person can be interfered with at the stage of FIR but not if it has advanced and the allegations have materialised into a charge-sheet. On the contrary it could be said that the abuse of process caused by FIR stands aggravated if the FIR has taken the form of a charge-sheet after investigation. The power is undoubtedly conferred to prevent abuse of process of power of any court.” Similar view is taken by this Court in Joseph Salvaraj A. v. State of Gujarat;10 A.M. Mohan v. State;11 Mamta Shailesh Chandra v. State of Uttarakhand.12 9 [2018] 13 SCR 1028 : (2019) 11 SCC 706. 10 [2011] 8 SCR 815 : (2011) 7 SCC 59. 11 [2024] 3 SCR 722 : 2024 SCC OnLine SC 339. 12 2024 SCC OnLine SC 136. 78 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 17. Having considered the matter in detail, we are of the opinion that none of the ingredients of Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 read with Section 34 IPC are made out. We have no hesitation in arriving at the conclusion that if the criminal proceedings are allowed to continue against the appellants, the same will be nothing short of abuse of process of law and travesty of justice. Though the appellants have also argued on the ground that Jalna Police Station and the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jalna did not have jurisdiction, we are not inclined to examine that position in view of our finding that the Complaint/ FIR and the chargesheet cannot be sustained. 18. For the reasons above mentioned, we allow the present appeal, set aside the impugned and of the High Court in Criminal Application No. 4015 of 2014 dated 05.05.2017, and quash FIR dated 25.03.2013 bearing Crime No. 81/2013 filed under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 read with Section 34 IPC at P.S. Jalna and the chargesheet dated 30.07.2013 bearing Chargesheet No. 123/2013 in the above FIR. Result of the Case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey
