Hence, I A have come to the conclusion that the death of the deceased is an “accidental death” and submittingthefinalreport. The case ends.” 15.The Southern Railway submitted the investigation report dated B 7.6.2017 under Rule 7(2) of the Railway Passengers (Manner of Investigation of Untoward Incidents) Rules, 2003 (for short “Rules, 2003). The said report refers the intimation to the Station Master, Mahadanapuram, wherein the occurrence of untoward incident has not been denied except to say that the passenger was travelling without a ticket. In the said report, final conclusion of the enquiry was reported as C under: “Enquiry reveals that on 27.9.2014, the deceased was on his way to Government Hospital, Karur for medical treatment and travelled in T.No. 56841 Pass (Ex.

The said finding of the investigation was recorded after considering the statement of D. Ravisankar, Station Master, Tanjore, who was on duty at Mahadanapuram Railway Station on 27.9.2014. As per his statement, it is apparent that on 27.09.2014, Train No. 56841 arrived E at Mahadanapuram at 08:43 hrs and left at 08:44 hrs. While moving from platform it was stopped due to ACP in Coach No. 01446. When he attended the said coach, he noticed one male person aged about 50 years was run over and died on the track. Therefore, even as per the statement of D.

G On perusal of the allegations of the FIR, inquest report, final report and the investigation report prepared under Rule 7 of the Rules, 2003, the allegation regarding an untoward incident, as pleaded in the claim petition, is fully established and supported by the testimony of Manikandan-AW1, son of the deceased. Therefore, the findings recorded in this regard by H 408 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A the Claims Tribunal and the High Court are without considering the documents of the investigation and the final report accepted by the DRM on 7.6.2017 and therefore such findings are perverse and set-aside. 18.Now, reverting to the issue whether the deceased was a bona fide passenger?
