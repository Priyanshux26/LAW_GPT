Ravikumar, J. ]: Criminal Appeal No.1614/2012 stood abated as the sole appellant who was the first accused (A1) died on 06.03.2022 – In the instant case, the very case of the prosecution is that body recovered from forest area was of victim-S – When once identification of the dead body as that of victim based on fingerprint test is reversed by the High Court, in the absence of appeal by the State or the victim, it could not be said that the dead body is that of victim, either for holding the appellant-convicts guilty of the offence u/s. 300, IPC punishable u/s. 302, IPC, or under Part -I / Part-II of s.304, IPC – However, in view of the findings confirming custodial torture, A2, A3, A4, A5 convicted are convicted u/ss. 330, 348 and 387 r/w. s.34, IPC – All the appellant-convicts acquitted of all the other offences for * Author [2024] 9 S.C.R. 725 Manik & Ors. v.

Appeal Nos. 1617 of 2012, 1618 of 2012 and, 1616 of 2012, that too in case any sentence remains unserved in view of confirmation of conviction and sentence u/ss. 330, 348 and 387 r/w. s.34, IPC. [Paras 1, 31 and 53] – [Per Sanjay Kumar, J. (dissenting)]: Nothing on record to support and substantiate that Criminal Appeal No. 1614 of 2012 stands abated as accused A1 died on 06.03.2022 – There is a major point of divergence in views regarding the tracing of dead body and proving to be of that person – Permitting the premise that once the dead body is said to have been traced and not proved to be of that person, same would be fatal to the case of the prosecution, such an acceptance would mean that those in the police organization, who resort to such nefarious methods, can take this easy way out to ward off a finding of guilt – When sufficient evidence is available to conclude that victim was in no position to escape from the custody of the appellants, the inevitable corollary that follows is that he died due to their torture while in their custody – Disagreed with the conclusion drawn that in the absence of evidence regarding the homicidal death of victim-S, the appellants are entitled to be acquitted of the charge u/s.
