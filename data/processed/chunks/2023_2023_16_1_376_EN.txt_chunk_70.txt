We are conscious that this Court in SR Bommai (supra) held that status quo ante can be restored upon fi nding that the Proclamation is invalid and the Court has the power to validate specifi c actions which were taken when the Proclamation was in force. The petitioners have assailed the specifi c actions which were taken when the Proclamation was in force on the ground that these actions breach the constitutional limitations on the exercise 171 WP (C) 1068 of 2019 assails the validity of the 2018 Proclamation and its extension but does not mention any grounds for the challenge. WP (C) 1099 of 2019 and WP (C) 1165 of 2019 have challenged the suspension of the proviso to Article 3 by the 2018 Proclamation but not the 2018 Proclamation itself. One of the grounds in WP (C) 1165 of 2019 is that the 2018 Proclamation is invalid but no reasons are mentioned. 106 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. of power after a Proclamation under Article 356 is issued. These substantive challenges which form the fulcrum of the case of the petitioners are being considered in the section below. iii. Limitations on the exercise of power by President or Parliament under Article 356 175. It now falls upon us to address the argument of the petitioners that the impugned COs could not have been issued and the Reorganization Act could not have been enacted when Article 356 was in operation in the State of Jammu and Kashmir. The petitioners submit that the State’s executive and legislative power cannot be exercised by the Union under Article 356 to: (a) take irrevocable decisions when the Proclamation has a limited shelf life. The power must be limited to actions that restore the constitutional machinery in the State along with s which are necessary for the purposes of daily administration; and (b) unsettle constitutional safeguards in favour of States. 176. On the other hand, the Union Government contends that to read any further limitations on the exercise of the powers of the President or of Parliament under Article 356, in addition to the limitations expressly provided in the Constitution, would amount to this Court undertaking an exercise of redrafting the provision. 177. The issues that fall for consideration are whether (a) there are any limits on the exercise of executive and legislative power of the States by the Union after a Proclamation is issued under Article 356; and (b) if so, the scope of judicial review of such exercise of power. a. Presidential Proclamation under Article 356 178. Article 355 provides that it is the duty of the Union to protect every State against external aggression and internal disturbance, and to “ensure that the government of every State is carried in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution.” 179. Article 356 deals with a failure of constitutional machinery in a state. Clause 1 of Article 356 outlines both the substantive threshold for the invocation of President’s rule and the legal powers that are delegated to the President and Parliament upon the invocation of President’s rule.
