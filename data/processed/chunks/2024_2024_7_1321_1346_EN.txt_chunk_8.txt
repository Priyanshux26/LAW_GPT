Digital Supreme Court Reports however, clarified that the pendency of Special Leave Petitions would not pose an impediment to the Division Bench of the High Court in deciding the State’s intra-court appeal expeditiously. 29. In the midst of all of these proceedings and in light of this Court’s dated 13.02.2023, the High Court passed the Impugned dated 06.04.2023 dismissing the application for condonation of delay of 428 days filed by the Appellant-State. Consequently, the State’s intra-court appeal stood rejected, giving rise to the instant proceedings. 30. The sole issue that arises for our consideration, thus, is whether the SDI/ABSA and DBSA are entitled to the higher pay scale of 7500-12000 with effect from 01.07.2001 or whether it has been appropriately granted to them from 01.12.2008 onwards? CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES 31. Learned Additional Solicitor General of India and Learned Additional Advocate General, while arguing for the State of Uttar Pradesh, urged that the consequence of the directions issued by the Learned Single Judge is that the earlier Division Bench judgement of the HC dated 06.05.2002 stands restored even though the said judgement was no longer in existence as it stood merged in the self-speaking dated 08.12.2010 passed by this Court in Civil Appeal No. 8869/2003, which was directed against the said judgement of the High Court. They pointed out that the financial implications of the directions issued by the Single Judge of the High Court are enormous, as an additional burden of approximately Rupees 1500 Crores shall be fastened on the state exchequer. 32. They fervently submitted that regardless of the negligence of some officers who failed to file the intra-court appeal promptly and did not render any satisfactory explanation for the inordinate delay, the Division Bench of the HC ought to have appreciated the impersonal character of the State and condoned the delay so that the intra court appeal could be heard on merits. It was emphasized that in deference to the dated 08.12.2010 of this Court, which explicitly approved the proposed settlement between the parties, the State Government issued the 2011 whereby substantial relief with actual arrears of pay with effect from 01.12.2008 had been already granted to the [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1335 State of Uttar Pradesh and Anr. v. Virendra Bahadur Katheria and Ors. Respondents and other similarly placed employees of their cadre. The 2011 , it was urged on behalf of the Appellant State, was in conformity with the final passed by this Court. 33. The Learned ASG relied upon the often quoted three-judge bench decision of this Court in Kunhayammed v. State of Kerala1 to reiterate that once this Court had granted leave against the High Court judgement dated 06.05.2002, the doctrine of merger would apply and it stood merged with the reasoned dated 08.12.2010, which was eventually passed by this Court. The Appellant-State was thus obligated to give effect to the passed by this Court. According to Learned ASG, this Court vide the dated 08.12.2010 dismissed the appeals after noticing the subsequent events that unfolded and held that ‘no further cause as such survives requiring any further adjudication of this appeal’.
