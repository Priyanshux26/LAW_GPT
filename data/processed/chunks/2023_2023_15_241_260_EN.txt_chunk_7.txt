PW27 Ramesan is the owner of the fi rm that sold Biosole to RR Distributors fi rm as deposed by PW26. He testifi es the factum of placing the of and delivery of 24 cans of 5L each to the said fi rm, vide bill (Ex.P12). He unrefutedly identifi ed A11 in Court and pertinently, testifi ed that the Biosole delivered by him was in the cans similar to MO15 series, which were marked as MO31 series, being the sample jar containing Biosole containing 100% methyl alcohol. 26. With the transaction of purchase and delivery of Biosole having been established beyond reasonable doubt, what needs to be examined further is also whether the record maintained by the fi rm of A11 was fabricated or not. In doing so, we examine the testimonies of the alleged purchasers, as depicted in the record. 27. PW28, Dr. Neelananda Sarma, running Ansar Hospital, denies having purchased Biosole from RR Distributors. On similar lines, PW29 Dr. A.M. Abdul Kuthoor, running City Hospital; PW30, Dr. Vijaya Chandran Nair, running KV Hospital; PW31 Sunil, running Cosmos Lab; PW32 Biji B, assistant at Koshy Dental Clinic and PW33 Dr. Roy George deny having made any purchase of Biosole from RR Distributors and denied the bill receipts marked by PW26. Thus, belying the defence set up by the appellants of having supplied the goods to these persons, rendering such entries being fi ctitious. 28. PW35, Roni is the elder brother of A11. He deposed that he is running a fi rm called RR Distributors, for which he has obtained a license. PW26 is the receptionist. This witness denies having made an earlier statement to the police and is declared hostile. Hence, in the cross- examination part of his testimony, it is revealed that the stamp paper of the Rent Deed (Ex.P14) was purchased in the name of A11. 29. The above witnesses bring to light the fact that actually it is A11, who is running and managing the fi rm RR Distributors. Further, Biosole, which contains 100% methyl alcohol was procured by A11 through his fi rm, RR Distributors.
