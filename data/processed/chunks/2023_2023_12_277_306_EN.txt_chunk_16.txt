Before the passing of the Amendment Act, 2015, it was the Central Government which had the ultimate control over the grant of licences insofar as mining of major minerals is concerned. As per the procedure then existing, the State Government could recommend the application submitted by any applicant for grant of mining lease to the Central Government and the Central Government was given the power to grant or refuse to grant the approval. Thus, “previous approval” from the Central Government was essential for grant of lease, without which the State Government could not enter 15 (2012) 4 SCC 246. 298 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. into any such lease agreement with the applicant. Shortcomings of this procedure were noticed by this Court in its rendered in Centre for Public Interest Litigation v. Union of India [(2012) 3 SCC 1] (for short “CPIL case”) and also in Natural Resources Allocation, In re, Special Reference No. 1 of 2012 [Natural Resources Allocation, In re, Special Reference No. 1 of 2012, (2012) 10 SCC 1] . In these s, this Court expressed that allocation of natural resources should normally be by auction. in CPIL case had a direct relevance to the grant of mineral concessions as the Government found that it was resulting in multipurpose litigation which was becoming counterproductive. Mining Ordinance, 2015 was passed on 12-1- 2015 which was ultimately replaced when Parliament enacted the Amendment Act, 2015. 18. The exhaustive Statement of Objects and Reasons reveals that the extensive amendment in the Act were eff ected after extensive consultations and intensive scrutiny by the Standing Committee on Coal and Steel, who gave their Report in May 2013. As is evident from the Statement that diffi culties were experienced because the existing Act does not permit the auctioning of mineral concessions. It was observed that with auctioning of mineral concessions, transparency in allocation will improve; the Government will get an increased share of the value of mineral resources; and that it will alleviate the procedural delay, which in turn would check slowdown which adversely aff ected the growth of mining sector. 19. The Amendment Act, 2015, as is evident from the objects, aims at: (i) eliminating discretion; (ii) improving transparency in the allocation of mineral resources; (iii) simplifying procedures; (iv) eliminating delay on administration, so as to enable expeditious and optimum development of the mineral resources of the country; (v) obtaining for the Government an enhanced share of the value of the mineral resources; and (vi) attracting private investment and the latest technology. 20. The Amendment Act, 2015 ushered in the amendment of Sections 3, 4, 4-A, 5, 6, 13, 15, 21 and First Schedule; substitution of new sections for Sections 8, 11 and 13; and, insertion of new Sections 8-A, 9-B, STATE OF WEST BENGAL v. M/S. CHIRANJILAL (MINERAL) 299 INDUSTRIES OF BAGANDIH [SANJIV KHANNA, J.] 9-C, 10-A, 10-C, 11-B, 11-C, 12-A, 15-A, 17-A, 20-A, 30-B, 30-C and Fourth Schedule. 21. These amendments brought in vogue: (i) auction to be the sole method of allotment; (ii) extension of tenure of existing lease from the date of their last renewal to 31-3-2030 (in the case of captive mines) and till 31-3-2020 (for the merchant miners) or till the completion of renewal already granted, if any, or a period of 50 years from the date of grant of such lease; (iii) establishment of District Mineral Foundation for safeguarding interest of persons aff ected by mining related activities; (iv) setting up of a National Mineral Exploration Trust created out of contributions from the mining lease-holders, in to have a dedicated fund for encouraging exploration and investment; (v) removal of the provisions requiring “previous approval” from the Central Government for grant of mineral concessions in case of important minerals like iron ore, bauxite, manganese, etc.
