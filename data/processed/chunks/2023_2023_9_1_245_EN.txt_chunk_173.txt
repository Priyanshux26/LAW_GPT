It is the need of the E hour and advisable, in my view, to extend the protection available to the Chief Election Commissioner under the first proviso to Article 324(5) to other Election Commissioners as well until any law is being framed by the Parliament. XI. Directions F 126. Until the Parliament makes a law in consonance with Article 324(2) of the Constitution, the following guidelines shall be in effect: (1) We declare that the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and the Election Commissioners shall be made on the recommendations made by a three-member G Committee comprising of the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition of the Lok Sabha and in case no Leader of Opposition is available, the Leader of the largest opposition party in the Lok Sabha in terms of numerical strength and the Chief Justice of India. (2) It is desirable that the grounds of removal of the Election H Commissioners shall be the same as that of the Chief ANOOP BARANWAL v. UNION OF INDIA 245 [AJAY RASTOGI, J.] Election Commissioner that is on the like grounds as a Judge A of the Supreme Court subject to the “recommendation of the Chief Election Commissioner”as provided under the second proviso to Article 324(5) of the Constitution of India. (3) The conditions of service of the Election Commissioners shall not be varied to his disadvantage after appointment. B Bibhuti Bhushan Bose Writ petitions partly allowed.
