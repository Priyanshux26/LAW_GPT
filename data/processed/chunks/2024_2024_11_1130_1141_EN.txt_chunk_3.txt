9. Lastly, it is submitted that the plaintiff failed to seek the consequential relief of possession in her suit. As per Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, a suit for declaration without seeking consequential relief is not maintainable, and thus, the suit ought to have been dismissed on this ground alone. Arguments for the Plaintiff (Respondent) 10. Opposing the appeal, learned counsel for the plaintiff supports the concurrent findings of the Trial Court and the High Court. It is 1 In short, ‘the Act’ 2 In short, ‘the Code’ [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1135 Leela Agrawal v. Sarkar & Anr. argued that the mortgage was a simple mortgage, and the condition purporting to convert it into an absolute sale upon default is a clog on the equity of redemption and is void. It is argued that the plaintiff remained in possession of the suit land throughout, cultivating it continuously, which indicates that the transaction was not a mortgage by conditional sale. The exorbitant interest rate of 4% per month is unconscionable and supports the plaintiff’s contention that the terms were oppressive. 11. It is further argued that the plaintiff’s husband, who deposed on her behalf, had personal knowledge of the transaction and was competent to testify. The evidence provided by him is credible and sufficient to support the plaintiff’s case. 12. Regarding Section 165 of the Code, it is contended that the provision applies, rendering the mortgage invalid since the plaintiff was left with less than 10 acres of un-irrigated land after the mortgage. Analysis 13. The central issue for determination is whether the mortgage deed dated 17.10.1990 constitutes a mortgage by conditional sale under Section 58(c) of the Act, and whether the plaintiff is entitled to redeem the mortgage. To address this issue, it is pertinent to examine the provisions of Section 58(c) of the Act, which has been reproduced hereunder: “Section 58(c): Mortgage by conditional sale- Where, the mortgagor ostensibly sells the mortgaged property— on condition that on default of payment of the mortgage- money on a certain date the sale shall become absolute, or on condition that on such payment being made the sale shall become void, or on condition that on such payment being made the buyer shall transfer the property to the seller, the transaction is called mortgage by conditional sale and the mortgagee a mortgagee by conditional sale: 1136 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Provided that no such transaction shall be deemed to be a mortgage, unless the condition is embodied in the document which effects or purports to affect the sale.” 14. On a bare reading of this provision, it can be deduced that the ingredients of a mortgage by conditional sale under Section 58(c) of the Act are as follows: (i) The mortgagor ostensibly sells the mortgaged property to the mortgagee. (ii) Such ostensible sale is subject to any one of the following conditions: • On default of payment of the mortgage-money on a certain date, the sale shall become absolute; or • On payment of the mortgage-money on a certain date, the sale shall become void; or • On payment of the mortgage-money on a certain date, the buyer shall retransfer the property to the seller.
