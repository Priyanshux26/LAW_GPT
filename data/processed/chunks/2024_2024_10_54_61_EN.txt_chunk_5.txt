[2024] 10 S.C.R. 61 Parveen Kumar v. The State of Himachal Pradesh 11. In that view of the matter, the High Court has rightly raised the presumption under Section 113A of the Evidence Act to hold that the suicide was abetted by the Appellant. There cannot be any disagreement to the proposition laid down by this Court in case of Hans Raj vs. State of Haryana (supra) and Naresh Kumar vs. State of Haryana (supra) relied upon by the learned Counsel for the Appellant, to submit that unlike Section 113B of the Evidence Act, a statutory presumption does not arise in Section 113A by operation of law merely on the proof of the circumstances enumerated in the said provision, and that Section 113A gives a discretion to the Court to raise a presumption. As discussed hereinabove the prosecution by leading cogent evidence had established that the deceased had committed suicide within a period of seven years from the date of her marriage and that the Appellant that is her husband had subjected her to cruelty as contemplated in Section 498-A of IPC. We therefore, do not find any illegality or infirmity in the impugned passed by the High Court convicting the Appellant for the offences under Section 498-A r/w Section 306 of IPC. 12. The Appeals being devoid of merits are dismissed. Dismissed accordingly. Result of the Case: Appeal dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
