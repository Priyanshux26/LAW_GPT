F. Nemo judex rule and the doctrine of bias 76. The principles of natural justice principally consist of two rules: (i) no one shall be a judge in their own cause (nemo judex in causa sua); and (ii) no decision shall be given against a party without affording a reasonable opportunity of being heard.141 Adherence to the principles of natural justice is a facet of procedural fairness. A decision made by the State to the prejudice of a person must be after following the basic rules of justice and fair play.142 The principles of natural justice are applied because administrative or quasi-judicial proceedings expression. Whatever destroys the meaning of that participation destroys the integrity of adjudication itself. Thus, participation through reasoned argument loses its meaning if the arbiter of the dispute is inaccessible to reason because he is insane, has been bribed, or is hopelessly prejudiced.”] 140 Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. v.

The intrinsic function values natural justice as an end in itself. It values natural justice as an essential feature of fairness. In its instrumental element, natural justice is viewed as a means to achieving just outcomes. 77. The principle of nemo judex is based on the precept that justice should not only be done but manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done.145 The principle of nemo judex applies to judicial, quasi-judicial, and administrative proceedings.146 An adjudicator should be disinterested and unbiased.147 A bias is a predisposition to decide for or against one party, without proper regard to the true merits of the dispute.148 i. Principles of natural justice 78. Article 14 of the Constitution provides that the State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or equal protection of the laws within the territory of India. Article 14 is founded on a sound public policy to secure to all persons, citizens or non-citizens, the equality of status and opportunity.149 One of the dimensions of the equality jurisprudence evolved by this Court is that arbitrariness is antithetical to equality.150 State action must be based on principles of fairness and equality of treatment.151 Article 14 strikes at arbitrary actions and ensures fairness and equality of treatment.152 Violation 143 Union of India v.
