Digital Supreme Court Reports purchased by the respondents-plaintiffs from Panchayat Titardi on 13.12.1959 and a boundary wall was constructed in the year 1960. The suit was filed as a notice was issued by the appellants under Section 92A of the 1959 Act6. 5. The stand taken by the appellants in the written statement was that the land in question is a Government land (Bilanam Sarkar) earmarked for grazing cattles (gochar land), which was forming part of Khasra No. 1163 ( old Khasra No. 838) in village Mauza Madri Menaria, Tehsil Girva. The Gram Panchayat, Titardi was not competent to grant lease in respect to the aforesaid land, especially when it was ear-marked for grazing cattles. Notice was issued on receiving information that the respondents-plaintiffs had encroached upon the land. It was also pleaded that Gram Panchayat, Titardi was a necessary party but had not been impleaded. In the revenue record, the land was still shown to be owned by the Government. In case the claim of respondents- plaintiffs was that it was given on lease to them, there was no mutation entered on the basis thereof.
