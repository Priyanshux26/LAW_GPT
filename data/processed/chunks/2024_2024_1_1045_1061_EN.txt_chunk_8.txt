In support of this submission, reliance has been placed on the summary of payments and security package forming a part of clause 6.4.4 of the Resolution Plan; (ii) The SRA was in the first tranche required to pay an amount of up to Rs 185 crores against the creation of securities, namely, (i) PBG of Rs 47.5 crores; (ii) BKC Property (if given); and (iii) 1058 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Mortgage over Dubai Property No 1 valued at over Rs 100 crores. In the last column of the table, it has been stipulated that the securities would be released, as indicated; (iii) The PBG was liable to be adjusted against the cash payment of the first tranche of Rs 185 crores; (iv) No specific date for the release of the security in relation to the PBG has been mentioned; (v) Moreover, in respect of the second tranche comprising of Rs 195 crores, there was no requirement to furnish any security in the form of a PBG; (vi) The securities, in other words, were of a revolving nature, but significantly on the release of the PBG against a cash payment of Rs 185 crores, the PBG is not required to be renewed as a fresh security for the following tranches; and (vii) As regards the creation of security in respect of the Dubai property, at all material times, the SRA has been ready and willing to effect the security and, as a matter of fact, this is evident in the 37th Meeting of the Monitoring Committee of the Corporate Debtor held on 9 October 2023. 19. While considering the rival submissions, it must be noted, at the outset, that the appeal, stemming from the NCLT’s January 13 2023 holding that the SRA is compliant with the conditions precedent is pending before the NCLAT. Hence, the observations in the present are confined to the arrangement which must operate during the pendency of the appeal without this Court expressing a final view on the merits of the appeal, which will fall for consideration before the NCLAT. 20. The occasion for an extension of time to the SRA for the deposit of Rs 350 crores arose as a consequence of the affidavit which was filed by SBI before the NCLAT on 16 August 2023. SBI’s affidavit envisaged that the lenders would not contest the issues pertaining to (a) the grant or exclusion of time; or (b) extension in terms of the s which were passed by the NCLT on 13 January 2023 and 26 May 2023; and (c) compliance of the conditions precedent by the SRA. SBI’s offer was, however, subject to the fulfillment of three conditions. The three conditions were: [2024] 1 S.C.R. 1059 State Bank of India and Ors v. The Consortium of Mr Murari Lal Jalan and Mr Florian Fritsch and Anr (i) The SRA must infuse an amount of Rs 350 crores by 31 August 2023 (the date by which the payment was to be made in terms of the Resolution Plan read with the dated 26 May 2023 of NCLT); (ii) The SRA must undertake to scrupulously follow the other terms and conditions of the Resolution Plan; and (iii) The SRA must comply with the liabilities in regard to the payment to the employees in terms of the of the NCLAT dated 21 October 2022 which has been upheld by this Court on 30 January 2023.
