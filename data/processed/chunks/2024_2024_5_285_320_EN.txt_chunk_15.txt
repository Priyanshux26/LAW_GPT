The NIACL responded by their letter of 07.03.2000 granting extension of 12 months for reinstatement of the damaged mill. All these clearly indicate that the Reinstatement Value [2024] 5 S.C.R. 307 New India Assurance Company Ltd. Through its Manager v. M/s Tata Steel Ltd. Clause was part of the policy and that the Insured had agreed to reinstate in accordance with the said clause. Thereafter, the Insured wrote a letter dated 28.04.2000 clearly setting out the following: “This has reference to the correspondence in connection with the above referred claim. After detailed discussions on various occasions with the loss assessors appointed by you, we accepted the settlement arrived at by the surveyor on repair loss basis. As desired by the surveyors, we gave a letter of acceptance vide letter dated 16.6.99 for the assessment of the net adjusted loss of Rs. 20.95 Crores after taking into account the items of salvage and excesses as applicable under the terms of the policy (copy enclosed). It is regretted that even after releasing on account payment of Rs. 5 Crore on 24th March, 1999 the matter is lying pending for the last about 1½ year in spite of our various meetings with you and also various letters written from time to time.” 49. It is very clear from this letter that the Insured accepted the net adjusted loss of Rs.20.95 Crores and a letter accepting the same dated 16.06.1999 was given to the surveyor. Thereafter, the Insured, getting no response, on 30.05.2000, filed the Consumer Complaint No. 233 of 2000 for the following reliefs: a) Rs. 15.95 crores on account of balance claim for fire loss. b) Interest @ 18% from 16.06.1999 till its actual payment. c) Rs. 73 lacs on account of inspection and transportation charges. d) Damages @ Rs. 3 crores per month since August, 1999 till the release of payment as prayed for under claim (a). 50. From the written statement, apart from the other facts, it was set out that on 06.10.1999, the Chief Vigilance Officer has suggested that the opinion of technical expert be taken before taking the final decision in the matter. Thereafter, further complaints were received resulting in the appointment of M/s J. Basheer & Associates who submitted their report on 10.04.2000. It was also averred that on 26.07.2000, the CBI approached NIACL with respect to some complaint filed by the Respondent and in that context, the CBI had called the officials of NIACL on 26.07.2000, 20.03.2001, 29.03.2001. Earlier on 16.04.2000, 308 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the CBI requisitioned the Respondent’s claim file pertaining to the case. It was averred that on 18.09.2000, NIACL appointed M/s Allianz Zentrum Fur Technik GmBH, Germany who gave their opinion on 26.10.2000. Since that report was not based on physical examination, Allianz was called to do a physical examination and the detailed report came on 10.07.2001. On 11.12.2001, according to NIACL, the Joint Surveyors submitted their report where they assessed the loss of the damaged mill at 19.55 crores on replacement basis and 13.51 crores on depreciation basis.
