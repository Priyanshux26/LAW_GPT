While considering the question/issue ‘Whether the period of parole is to be excluded from the period of sentence E under Rules of 2006 while considering 14 years of actual imprisonment for the purpose of premature release ?’, the object and purpose of parole is required to be taken into consideration.

For parole, specific reason is required. Parole can be granted for number of times. [Para 5][1032-G] 2. The High Court while passing the impugned and and taking the view that the period of parole is to be G excluded from the period of sentence while considering 14 years of actual imprisonment has heavily relied upon or considered Rule 335 of the Rules, 2006 which provides that the period of release on Furlough and Parole “shall be counted as remission of sentence ….”. Once the period of parole is to be counted as remission of sentence, as rightly observed and held by the High H 1029 1030 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A Court, the period of parole is also required to be excluded from the period of sentence while considering 14 years of actual imprisonment. [Para 7.1][1033-B-D] 3. If the submission on behalf of the prisoners that the period of parole is to be included while considering 14 years of B actual imprisonment is accepted, in that case, any prisoner who may be influential may get the parole for number of times as there is no restrictions and it can be granted number of times and if the submission on behalf of the prisoners is accepted, it may defeat the very object and purpose of actual imprisonment. This Court is of the firm view that for the purpose of considering C actual imprisonment, the period of parole is to be excluded.
