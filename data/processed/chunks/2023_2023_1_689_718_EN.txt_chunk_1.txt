[Para 9.2][710-C-D] 2.1 Chapter XIV-B which deals with block assessment lays down a special procedure for searched cases. The main reason for adding the said provisions in the Act was to curb tax evasion D and expedite as well as simplify the assessment in such searched cases. The essence of the new procedure under Chapter XIV-B is a separate single assessment of the “undisclosed income”, detected as a result of search and this separate assessment has to be in addition to the normal assessment covering the said E period. Therefore, a separate return covering the years of the block period is a pre-requisite for making block assessment. Chapter XIV-B is a complete code in itself providing for self-contained machinery for assessment of undisclosed income for the block period of 10 years or 6 years as the case may be. [Para 10][710-F-H] F 2.2 With respect to assessment of undisclosed income for the block period including the filing of the return etc., the normal assessment proceedings including under Section 140 of the Income Tax Act shall not be applicable. Therefore, the submission on behalf of the assessee that interest under Section 158BFA for G the period prior to 01.06.1999 in view of insertion of the words “Section 158BC” in Section 140A w.e.f. 01.06.1999, shall not be chargeable, cannot be accepted. It is the case on behalf of the assessee that the interest only follows the principal and in this case the principal being the tax payable, there was no liability to H K.L. SWAMY v. THE COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX & 691 ANR. pay the tax along with the return prior to 01.06.1999 which came A to be introduced by insertion of the words “Section 158BC” in Section 140A and therefore the liability to pay interest cannot arise if there was no liability to pay the tax itself along with the return at the relevant time, has no substance. At this stage, it requires to be noted that neither Section 158BC nor Section B 158BFA required the assessee to pay tax along with the return. Liability to deposit the tax along with return arises only under Section 140A. However, at the relevant point of time Section 140A did not apply to Section 158BC and hence there was no liability to deposit tax along with the return. The said lacunae was noticed by the Parliament and by the Finance Act, 1999, the C words “Section 158BC” have been inserted in Section 140A w.e.f. 01.06.1999. That does not mean that interest under Section 158BFA would not be leviable in case of late filing of return. The return under Section 158BC was required to be filed as per Chapter XIV-B and on the delay in filing the return, there shall D be liability to pay interest leviable under Section 158BFA(1). [Para 10.1][713-D-H; 714-A-B] 2.3 On conjoint reading of the Notes on Clauses and Memorandum, it is very clear that the Legislature originally intended to make the assessee liable to pay taxes and interest E when the return was filed under Section 139 or under Section 142 or Section 148.
