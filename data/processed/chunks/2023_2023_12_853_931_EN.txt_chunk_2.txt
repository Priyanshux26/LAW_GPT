[Para 45] Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Inquiry and investigation: Held: For an inquiry and investigation there can be same materials, while there is no bar for reliance on additional ones – They can travel in the same channel, but their destinations are diff erent – One material can be used for both purposes, along with numerous others – So long as they 856 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. travel together, there is not much of a diff erence between an inquiry and investigation – When they take separate routes, an inquiry ends before the Adjudicating Authority, while the other leads to a Special Court in the form of a complaint. [Para 46] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – Detention and custody: Held: Section 167(2) of the CrPC, 1973 authorises the detention of the accused in custody by an of the Magistrate – It does consciously treat a detention diff erent from custody – Custody will be either to the court or an investigating agency – Detention is normally made only by an investigating agency prior to the production before the Magistrate – A custody from being judicial may turn into police through an passed by the Magistrate – Detention may at best be a facet of custody – However, they are not synonymous with each other – When detention is authorised, it would become custody.
