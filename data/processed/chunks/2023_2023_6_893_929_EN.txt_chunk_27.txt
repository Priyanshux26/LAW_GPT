Unless E the equity of redemption is so extinguished, a second suit for redemption by the mortgagor, if filed within the period of limitation, is not therefore barred. 62. It follows, therefore, that if the right of redemption is not extinguished, the provision like IX Rule 9 of the CPC will not F debar the mortgagor from filing a second suit because as in a partition suit, the cause of action in a redemption suit is a recurring one. The cause of action in each successive action, until the right of redemption is extinguished or a suit for redemption is time barred, is a different one. 63. In the result, this appeal fails and is hereby dismissed. G 64. The interim passed by this Court dated 3.01.2019 staying the further proceedings of Suit No. 154 of 2009 pending in the Court of Civil Judge (J.D.) Eastern, District Ballia is hereby vacated. 65.
