82. A “lease” connotes a transfer of a right of enjoyment in immoveable property for a certain time in lieu of consideration.108 Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act 1882 defines a lease of immoveable property as a transfer of a right to enjoy such property, made for a certain time, express or implied, or in perpetuity, in consideration of a price paid or promised, or of money, a share of crops, service or any other thing of value, to be rendered periodically or on specified occasions to the transferor by the transferee, who accepts the transfer on such terms.109 The provision defines ‘lessor’, ‘lessee’, ‘premium’, and ‘rent’. The “transferor is called the lessor, the transferee is called the lessee, the price is called the premium, and the money, share, service or other thing to be so rendered is called the rent.” This Court has interpreted the expression “rent” widely to mean any payment for the use or occupation of land or building including the payment by a lessee in respect of the use or occupation of any land or building.110 83. According to Section 3(26) of the General Clauses Act 1897, immoveable property is defined to include land, benefits to arise out of land, and things attached to the earth, or permanently fastened to anything attached to the earth.111 Section 2(6) of the Registration Act defines immoveable property to include land, buildings, hereditary allowance, rights of way, lights, ferries, fisheries, or any other benefit to arise out of land, and things attached to earth, or permanently 107 [1967] 1 SCR 695 108 Mulla on the Transfer of Property Act 1882 (13th edn) 109 Section 105, Transfer of Property Act 1882 110 State of Punjab v. British India Corporation [1964] 2 SCR 114 [15] 111 Section 3(26), General Clauses Act 1897. [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1633 Mineral Area Development Authority & Anr. v. M/s Steel Authority of India & Anr. Etc. fastened to anything which is attached to the earth, except for standing timber, growing crops, and grass.112 A mineral is also a benefit arising out of land. The right to carry out mining operations to extract minerals under a mining lease has been held by this Court to be a right to enjoy immoveable property within the meaning of Section 105.113 84. The expression “licence” is defined in the Indian Easements Act 1882 as follows: “52. “License” defined. – Where one person grants to another, or to a definite number of other persons, a right to do, or continue to do, in or upon the immoveable property of the grantor, something which would, in the absence of such right, be unlawful, and such right does not amount to an easement or an interest in the property, the right is called a licence.”114 85. In Associated Hotels of India Ltd v. R N Kapoor,115 Justice K Subba Rao (as the learned Chief Justice then was) observed that a lease creates an interest in property, while a licence only permits another to make use of the property, whose legal possession continues to remain with the owner.
