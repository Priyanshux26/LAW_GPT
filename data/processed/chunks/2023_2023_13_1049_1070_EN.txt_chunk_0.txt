OKA AND PANKAJ MITHAL, JJ.] HEADNOTES Issue for consideration: Whether the off ence u/s.120B, IPC included in Paragraph 1 of the Schedule to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, can be treated as a scheduled off ence even if the criminal conspiracy alleged is to commit an off ence which is not a part of the Schedule. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – Paragraph 1 of the Schedule – Penal Code, 1860 – s.120B – Appellant purchased the fi rst property from Alliance Business School and the second property from accused no.1 against whom an FIR was registered alleging that he collected Rs.107 crores from the students by claiming himself as the Chancellor of the Alliance University – Four FIRs, ECIR registered – Complaint fi led against the appellant-accused alleging that she entered into a conspiracy with accused no.1 by getting executed nominal sale deeds in respect of the fi rst and second properties in her name for the benefi t of accused no.1 and facilitated him to use her bank accounts to siphon the university funds, assisting him in the activity connected with the proceeds of crime – Petition for quashing the complaint fi led by the appellant, dismissed by High Court – Appellant pleaded that out of the four scheduled/predicate off ences, chargesheets were fi led in the case of three off ences wherein only one off ence covered by the Schedule to the PMLA was mentioned– It was thus contended that s.120B of IPC alone, in the absence of any other scheduled off ence cannot sustain a charge under the PMLA and unless there is an allegation regarding a conspiracy to commit any scheduled off ence, the prosecution under the PMLA cannot lie: 1049 105 0 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. Held: The off ence punishable u/s.120B of the IPC will become a scheduled off ence only if the conspiracy alleged is of committing an off ence which is specifi cally included in the Schedule – In the present case, in the chargesheets fi led in the alleged scheduled off ences, there is no allegation of the commission of criminal conspiracy to commit any of the off ences included in the Schedule – Except for s.120B, IPC, no other off ence in the schedule was applied – Therefore, in this case, the scheduled off ence does not exist at all – Hence, the appellant cannot be prosecuted for the off ences punishable u/s.3, PMLA – Impugned quashed and set aside – Complaint pending before the Special Court for PMLA cases, Bengaluru quashed as regards the present appellant – Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.482. [Paras 26, 27] Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 – s.3 – Plea of the appellant that as she was not arraigned as an accused in the chargesheets fi led pertaining to the alleged scheduled off ences, she cannot be roped in as an accused for the off ences punishable u/s.3: Held: In a given case, if the prosecution for the scheduled off ence ends in the acquittal of all the accused or discharge of all the accused or the proceedings of the scheduled off ence are quashed in its entirety, the scheduled off ence will not exist, and therefore, no one can be prosecuted for the off ence punishable u/s.3 of the PMLA as there will not be any proceeds of crime – Thus, in such a case, the accused against whom the complaint u/s.3 of the PMLA is fi led will benefi t from the scheduled off ence ending by acquittal or discharge of all the accused – Similarly, he will get the benefi t of quashing the proceedings of the scheduled off ence – However, an accused in the PMLA case who comes into the picture after the scheduled off ence is committed by assisting in the concealment or use of proceeds of crime need not be an accused in the scheduled off ence – Such an accused can still be prosecuted under PMLA so long as the scheduled off ence exists – An off ence u/s.3 can be committed after a scheduled off ence is committed – It is not necessary that a person against whom the off ence u/s.3 is alleged must have been shown as the accused in the scheduled off ence – Plea of the appellant rejected.
