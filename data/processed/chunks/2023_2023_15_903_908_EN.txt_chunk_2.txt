This provision reads:- “The provisions of this Act to override other laws.-The provisions of this Act shall have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or any instrument having effect by virtue of any such law. 4. Notice under Section 13(2) of the 2002 Act was issued on 06.09.2013. The 2002 Act was subsequently amended with effect from 24.01.2020 upon introduction of Section 26E. This provision reads:- “26E. Priority to secured creditors.- Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, after the registration of security interest, the debts due to any secured creditor shall be paid in priority over all other debts and all revenues, taxes, cesses and other rates payable to the Central Government or State Government or local authority. Explanation.-For the purposes of this section, it is hereby clarified that on or after the commencement of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (31 of 2016), in cases where insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings are pending in respect of secured assets of the borrower, priority to secured creditors in payment of debt shall be subject to the provisions of that Code.” There is a Full Bench of the Bombay High Court in the case of Jalgaon Janta Sahakari Bank Ltd. & Anr. vs. Joint Commissioner of Sales Tax Nodal 9, Mumbai & Anr., reported in 2022 (5) Maharashtra Law Journal 691, in which it has been held that the operation of Section 26E of the 2002 Act would be prospective. 5. As the State action had commenced in the year 2014, the provision of Section 26E of the 2002 Act would not be applicable in this case. The said provision, having prospective effect cannot come to the aid of the bank. Thus, we will have to examine the implication of Section 35 of the said two statutes, i.e. the 2002 Act and the 2005 Act. PUNJAB & SIND BANK v. THE STATE OF PUNJAB & ANR. 907 6. In our opinion, the overriding provision of 2002 Act does not in any way eclipse the said provision creating fi rst charge under the State Act. At the material point of time, there was no inconsistency between the 2005 Act and the 2002 Act, so far as the creation of charge or priority on tax dues of a defaulting borrower to the State is concerned. Section 35 of the 2002 Act does not deal with the issue of creating priority for secured creditors, which is the specifi c mandate of Section 35 of the 2005 Act. The latter provision specifi cally deals with superiority of the State’s claim over assets of a tax defaulter. The claim of the State, which is in the nature of crown debt stands statutorily recognised as superior claim under Section 35 of the 2005 Act, and is given precedence. Thus, the common law principle of priority of crown debt, which principle applies against unsecured creditors only would not apply in this case. Once we examine the aforesaid provisions, sans Section 26E of the 2002 Act, Section 35 of the 2005 Act would prevail.
