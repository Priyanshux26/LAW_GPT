2– Collector accordingly referred the matter to the District Court on 18.12.1997. (vi) The Reference Court after considering the issue of limitation raised on behalf of the respondents in the said Reference, held that the Reference fi led with the Collector was within the period of limitation as per the of the High Court. The Reference Court further determined the amount of additional compensation to be paid to the appellant-trust vide the award dated 07.03.2006.

TRIVEDI, J.] (vii) The respondent no. 1- Committee, being aggrieved by the said award preferred the First Appeals being 1447 of 2006 and 1490 of 2006 before the High Court, which came to be allowed vide the impugned s as stated herein above. 3. The learned senior counsel Mr. B.H. Marlapalle appearing for the appellant- trust submitted that fi ndings arrived at by the High Court with regard to the issue of limitation are ex facie erroneous. According to him, though the consent terms, more particularly, clause (c) thereof was not happily worded, the High Court while disposing of the Writ Petition vide the dated 20.10.1997 had specifi cally directed the Reference Court to determine the market value of the lands in question as on 17.12.1994 as agreed between the parties, and therefore, the respondents could not have raised the issue of limitation contained in Section 18 of the Act. He further submitted that both the parties had to act in terms of the passed by the High Court based on the consent terms, and therefore the respondent- Committee could not have raised the issue of limitation under Section 18. 4. Per Contra, the learned senior Counsel Mr. Parag Tripathi appearing for respondent no. 1- Committee pressing into service clause (c) of the consent terms vehemently submitted that there being no time limit mentioned in the said clause, it was required to be construed that the appellant- trust had to make an application to the second respondent under Section 18 of the said Act within four weeks from the date of the passed by the High Court i.e. from 20.10.1997 and the appellant having made the application seeking reference on 03.12.1997 i.e. after four weeks of the dated 20.10.1997, such an application was clearly barred by limitation in view of the consent terms as well as under Section 18 of the said Act. 5. Having carefully gone through the dated 20.10.1997 passed by the High Court in Writ Petition No. 607 of 1996 based on the consent terms arrived at between the appellant- trust and the respondent no. 1- Committee, and the award passed by the Reference Court as also the impugned s and s passed by the High Court, we are of the opinion that the issue of limitation raised by respondent- Committee before the Reference Court and before the High Court was not only not tenable but was highly unreasonable and improper. As discernible from the consent terms, the very purpose of arriving at the said consent terms was to do away with the hardship caused 600 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R.
