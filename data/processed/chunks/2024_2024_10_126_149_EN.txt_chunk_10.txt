3 SCR 323 : (1999) 8 SCC 287 28 [1999] Supp. 4 SCR 302 : (1999) 9 SCC 596 29 [2011] 2 SCR 831 : (2011) 3 SCC 267 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 141 V. Vincent Velankanni v. The Union of India and Others one group of officers and the other recruited from different sources. Any departure therefrom in the statutory rules, executive instructions or otherwise must be consistent with the requirements of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. (iii) Ordinarily, notional seniority may not be granted from the backdate and if it is done, it must be based on objective considerations and on a valid classification and must be traceable to the statutory rules. (iv) The seniority cannot be reckoned from the date of occurrence of the vacancy and cannot be given retrospectively unless it is so expressly provided by the relevant service rules. It is so because seniority cannot be given on retrospective basis when an employee has not even been borne in the cadre and by doing so it may adversely affect the employees who have been appointed validly in the meantime. 34. Thus, it is trite that when an employee completes the probation period and is confirmed in service albeit with some delay, the confirmation in service shall relate back to the date of the initial appointment. Any departure from this principle in the form of statutory rules, executive instructions or otherwise must be consistent with the requirements of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. 35. In the backdrop of the above legal and factual background, let us now examine if whether the extant rules/regulations/circulars prevailing in the establishment30 contained any stipulation that the completion of the probation period and the passing of the trade test is sin qua non for being promoted to the skilled grade and if so, whether the seniority of the employees selected on the same date would have to be reckoned from the date of confirmation/passing the trade test or from the date of initial appointment. 36. A pertinent averment is made in the counter affidavit filed by the respondents emphasizing their stand that the semi-skilled grade is only a trainee grade and in to place an employee in the skilled grade, he would have to complete the probation period satisfactorily 30 Respondent No. 2-Factory 142 [2024] 10 S.C.R.
