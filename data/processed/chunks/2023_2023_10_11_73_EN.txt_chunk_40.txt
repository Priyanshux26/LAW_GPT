In other words, the reasoning adopted by the Trial Court and the High Court was that only A-1 and PW-16 were part of the conspiracy. Such a reasoning was a huge climbdown from the original charge that D A-1 to A-7 entered into a criminal conspiracy, to cause wrongful loss to BHEL and to confer a wrongful gain to A-5 to A-7. Once an offence of Section 120B is not made out against A-5 to A-7, the very foundation for the prosecution becomes shaky. Therefore, we are of the view that the conviction of A-1 for the offences under Section 120B read with Sections E 420, 468, Section 471 read with Section 468 and Section 193 IPC and Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(d) of the PC Act cannot be sustained. 104. We are surprised that A-1 was found guilty of an offence under Section 193. Section 193 applies only to false evidence given in any stage of a judicial proceeding or the fabrication of false evidence for F the purpose of being used in any stage of a judicial proceeding. The allegation against A-1 was not even remotely linked to any of the Explanations under Section 193 of the IPC. Therefore, the of the Trial Court and that of the High Court convicting A-1 for the aforesaid offences and sentencing him to imprisonment of varying terms and fines G of different amounts are liable to be reversed. As regards A-4 105. As can be seen from the of the Trial Court, A-4 was convicted for the offences under Section 109 read with Section 420, 468 IPC, Section 471 read with 468 IPC and Section 193 IPC. H 66 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 10 S.C.R. A 106. As we have pointed out in the last paragraph dealing with the case of A-1, Section 193 IPC deals with punishment for false evidence, given intentionally in any stage of a judicial proceeding. It also includes fabrication of false evidence for the purpose of being used in any stage of a judicial proceeding. There are three Explanations under Section 193. Explanation 2 under Section 193 makes an investigation directed by B law preliminary to a proceeding before a Court of Justice, to be a stage of judicial proceeding, though that investigation may not take place before a Court of Justice. Similarly, Explanation 3 makes an investigation directed by a Court of Justice according to law, and conducted under the authority of a Court of Justice, to be a stage of judicial proceeding, though that C investigation may not take place before a Court of Justice. 107. Interestingly, there was no allegation that either A-1 or A-3 or A-4 either gave false evidence or fabricated false evidence in any stage of a judicial proceeding, falling within any of the three Explanations under Section 193. But unfortunately, the Trial Court found A-4 guilty of D the offence under Section 193, without there being any specific allegation in the charge-sheet and without there being any specific finding on merits.
