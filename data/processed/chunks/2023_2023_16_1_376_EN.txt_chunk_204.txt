Once a prima facie case is made, the onus shifts to the Union to justify the exercise of such power; d. The power of Parliament under Article 356(1)(b) to exercise the powers of the Legislature of the State cannot be restricted to law-making power thereby excluding non-law making power of the Legislature of the State. Such an interpretation would amount to reading in a limitation into the provision contrary to the text of the Article; e. It can be garnered from the historical context for the inclusion of Article 370 and the placement of Article 370 in Part XXI of the Constitution that it is a temporary provision; * Ed. Note: PART F. IN RE: ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION 291 [DR DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] f. The power under Article 370(3) did not cease to exist upon the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir. When the Constituent Assembly was dissolved, only the transitional power recognised in the proviso to Article 370(3) which empowered the Constituent Assembly to make its recommendations ceased to exist. It did not aff ect the power held by the President under Article 370(3); g. Article 370 cannot be amended by exercise of power under Article 370(1)(d). Recourse must have been taken to the procedure contemplated by Article 370(3) if Article 370 is to cease to operate or is to be amended or modifi ed in its application to the State of Jammu and Kashmir. Paragraph 2 of CO 272 by which Article 370 was amended through Article 367 is ultra vires Article 370(1)(d) because it modifi es Article 370, in eff ect, without following the procedure prescribed to modify Article 370. An interpretation clause cannot be used to bypass the procedure laid down for amendment; h. The exercise of power by the President under Article 370(1)(d) to issue CO 272 is not mala fi de. The President in exercise of power under Article 370(3) can unilaterally issue a notifi cation that Article 370 ceases to exist. The President did not have to secure the concurrence of the Government of the State or Union Government acting on behalf of the State Government under the second proviso to Article 370(1)(d) while applying all the provisions of the Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir because such an exercise of power has the same eff ect as an exercise of power under Article 370(3) for which the concurrence or collaboration with the State Government was not required; i. Paragraph 2 of CO 272 issued by the President in exercise of power under Article 370(1)(d) applying all the provisions of the Constitution of India to the State of Jammu and Kashmir is valid. Such an exercise of power is not mala fi de merely because all the provisions were applied together without following a piece-meal approach; j. The President had the power to issue a notifi cation declaring that Article 370(3) ceases to operate without the recommendation of 292 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. the Constituent Assembly.
