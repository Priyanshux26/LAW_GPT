(2021) 10 SCC 773 – relied on. 1.3 The right of statutory bail, however, is extinguished, if the charge sheet is filed within the stipulated period. The question E of resorting to a supplementary chargesheet u/s 173(8) of the Cr.PC only arises after the main chargesheet has been filed, and as such, a supplementary chargesheet, wherein it is explicitly stated that the investigation is still pending, cannot under any circumstance, be used to scuttle the right of default bail, for then, F the entire purpose of default bail is defeated, and the filing of a chargesheet or a supplementary chargesheet becomes a mere formality, and a tool, to ensue that the right of default bail is scuttled. First investigation is to be completed, and only then can a chargesheet or a complaint be filed within the stipulated period, and failure to do so would trigger the statutory right of G default bail under Section 167(2) of Cr.PC. [Paras 24 and 25][840- G-H; 841-A-B] Union of India v. Thamisharasi & Ors. (1995) 4 SCC 190 : [1995] 3 SCR 905; Ashok Munilal Jain & Anr. H 828 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 3 S.C.R. A Vs. Assistant Director, Directorate of Enforcement(2018) 16 SCC 158 – relied on. 1.4 Without completing the investigation of a case, a chargesheet or prosecution complaint cannot be filed by an investigating agency only to deprive an arrested accused of his B right to default bail under Section 167(2) of the CrPC. Such a chargesheet, if filed by an investigating authority without first completing the investigation, would not extinguish the right to default bail under Section 167(2) CrPC. The trial court, in such cases, cannot continue to remand an arrested person beyond the maximum stipulated time without offering the arrested person C default bail. [Para 32][842-E-G] 1.5 In the instant case, during the pendency of the investigation, supplementary chargesheets were filed by the Investigation Agency just before the expiry of 60 days, with the purpose of scuttling the right to default bail accrued in favour the D accused. This factual position was missed by the trial court, and instead of offering default bail to the accused, the trial court mechanically accepted the incomplete chargesheets filed by the Investigating Agency, and further continued the remand of the accused beyond the maximum period specified. The Investigating E Agency and the trial court, thus, failed to observe the mandate of law, and acted in a manner which was manifestly arbitrary and violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed to the accused. The interim of bail passed in favor of the accused is made absolute. [Paras 33 and 35][843-A-C; 843-F] K. S. Puttaswamy & Anr. v. Union Of India & Ors. (2017) F 10 SCC 1 : [2017] 10 SCR 569; K.
