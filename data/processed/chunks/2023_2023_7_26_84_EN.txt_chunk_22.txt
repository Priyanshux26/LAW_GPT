The first is dated 27.07.2022,18 the second is dated D 18.01.2023 and the final one is dated 05.04.2023. In the first , this Court accepted the revision of pay structure as recommended by SNJPC. By dated 18.01.2023, this Court granted additional time to some States to comply with the dated 27.07.2022. Thereafter, some States and the Union filed review petitions against the dated 27.07.2022 passed by this Court. This Court dismissed the reviews on E 05.04.2023.19 Thus, most of the recommendations of the SNJPC on the pay structure have become final. 5.2 CONSIDERATION OF RECOMMENDATIONS ON PAY F 41. Individual recommendations made by the SNJPC on pay are considered hereinbelow. I. Redesignation of Judicial Officers in Conformity with the All India Pattern (Recommendation 44.1) 42. As stated above, in India, the judiciary is unified. The G designations of judges, therefore, ought to be uniform across the country. In this regard, the FNJPC suggested the following nomenclature to be adopted pan-India: 18 dated 27.07.2022 in WP(C) No.643/2015 at para 17. 19 dated 05.04.2023 in Review Petition (Diary No) 34780/2022 at para 19. H ALL INDIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION v. UNION OF INDIA 59 [PAMIDIGHANTAM SRI NARASIMHA, J.] i. Civil Judge (Jr. Div); A ii. Civil Judge (Sr. Div); iii. District Judge. 43. A thorough examination by the SNJPC revealed that these designations have not been adopted in few states. It was stated by the B Commission that the State of Kerala still designates its judges as Munsiff and ‘Subordinate Judge’. In the North-Eastern States too, it was seen that there was some divergence of designation. Uniformity would require these to be amended in to be brought under the same umbrella. Pertinently, this recommendation had been accepted in the FNJPC by C virtue of in All India Judges’ Assn. (II) v. Union of India, (1993) 4 SCC 288.20 We may only reiterate that this direction be followed by the High Courts and all High Courts amend their designations in conformity with the suggestions of the FNJPC and SNJPC. 44. It is also relevant to note that in light of the pay matrix suggested by the SNJPC, without uniform designations, issues may arise in the D future for fitment of the different designations which are used in the different states. Such complications ought to be avoided by this Court. 45. This Court thus accepts the recommendation of the Commission. Consequently, the High Courts are directed to ensure that the designation of judicial officers is uniformly the same as mentioned in E the above paragraphs. II. New Pay Structure as per Pay Matrix Model (Recommendation 44.2, 44.3) 46. The SNJPC has recommended that the pay matrix model, F which was adopted by the 7th Central Pay Commission be adopted for Judicial Officers as well. This is desirable as it simplifies the matter of pay for judges.
