1112 SUPREME CO[U20R2T3 ]R 2E SP.OC.RRT. S1112 [2023] 2 S.C.R. A MS. X v. THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA AND ANOTHER (Criminal Appeals Nos. 822-823 of 2023) B MARCH 17, 2023 [A. S. BOPANNA AND HIMA KOHLI, JJ.] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – ss. 437,438 and 439 – Penal Code, 1860 – ss. 354,354-B, 376 and 506 – Anticipatory bail – Cancellation of – A complaint filed by the appellant- C prosecutrix, against the respondent No.2-accused, who lured her under the garb of offering some modelling assignments, raped her in a hotel room where she was staying – Initially, the FIR was registered u/ss. 354, 354-B and 506 of the IPC, and later, on the supplementary statement of the appellant being recorded, the offence D u/s.376 was added to the FIR – The High Court granted anticipatory bail to the respondent No. 2 on the grounds that the appellant had improved her statement – On appeal, held: The nature and gravity of the alleged offence and the financial stature, position and standing of the accused vis-à-vis the appellant was disregarded and ignored by the High Court – There was sufficient material in E the FIR that would prima facie attract the provision of s. 376, IPC – Despite the appellant having filed an application for intervention in the petition for anticipatory bail moved by the Respondent No.2 before the High Court, she was not afforded a hearing – There is no other witness except for the appellant herself, High Court should F have granted opportunity of hearing – Grant of anticipatory bail cannot be sustained – of the High Court quashed and set aside. Disposing of the appeals, the Court Held: 1. The nature and gravity of the alleged offence has G been disregarded. So has the financial stature, position and standing of the accused vis-à-vis the appellant/prosecutrix been ignored. The High Court has granted anticipatory bail in favour of the respondent No. 2/accused in a brief of three paragraphs, having been swayed by the “star variations in the H narration of the prosecutrix” implying thereby that what was 1112 MS. X v. THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA AND ANOTHER 1113 originally recorded in the FIR, did not make out an offence of A rape, as defined in Section 375 IPC, which is an erroneous assumption. Even if the first Supplementary statement of the appellant/prosecutrix recorded in the evening hours of 6th August, 2022, the date on which the FIR had been registered against the respondent No.2/accused in the first half of the same day, her B second Supplementary statement recorded on 6th September, 2022 and the Medico-Legal Report of the doctor who had examined the appellant/prosecutrix on 8th August, 2022, are kept aside for a moment, this Court finds that there was still sufficient material in the FIR that would prima facie attract the provision of Section 376, IPC. In this Court’s opinion, these factors ought to C have dissuaded the High Court from exercising its discretion in favour of the respondent No.2/accused for granting him anticipatory bail.
