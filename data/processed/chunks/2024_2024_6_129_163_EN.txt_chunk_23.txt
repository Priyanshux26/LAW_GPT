The aforesaid is nothing but verbatim reproduction of Section 498A of the IPC. The only difference is that the Explanation to Section 498A of the IPC, is now by way of a separate provision, i.e., Section 86 of the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023. 40. We request the Legislature to look into the issue as highlighted above taking into consideration the pragmatic realities and consider [2024] 6 S.C.R. 163 Achin Gupta v. State of Haryana & Anr. making necessary changes in Sections 85 and 86 respectively of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, before both the new provisions come into force. 41. In the result, the appeal succeeds and is hereby allowed. The impugned and passed by the High Court is hereby set aside. 42. The proceedings of CHI/1856/2021 arising from FIR No. 95 of 2021 dated 09.04.2021, pending in the Court of Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Hisar are hereby quashed. 43. Pending application(s) if any shall be disposed of. 44. We direct the Registry to send one copy each of this to the Union Law Secretary and Union Home Secretary, to the Government of India who may place it before the Hon’ble Minister for Law and Justice as well as the Hon’ble Minister for Home.
