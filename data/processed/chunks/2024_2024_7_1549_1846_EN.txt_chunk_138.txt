While doing so, the Court will bear in mind the fundamental principle that the legislature possesses a broad discretion in matters of fiscal levies. a. Taxing mineral-bearing land 291. The tax on lands and buildings under Entry 49 of List II is often measured with respect to the income derived from the land or building sought to be taxed. The income derived from land or building is normally measured in terms of the annual value. Section 23 of the Income Tax Act provides that the annual value of property shall be deemed to be the sum for which the property might reasonably be expected to let from year to year.371 Thus, where a land or building is let, the valuation is based on the rent at which it is let.372 369 [2018] 6 SCR 1099 : (2018) 7 SCC 233 370 Express Hotels (P) Ltd. v. State of Gujarat (1989) 3 SCC 677 [25] 371 Section 23, I T Act 1961 372 Patel Gordhandas Hargovindas v. Municipal Commissioner, 1963 SCC OnLine SC 57 [10] [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1725 Mineral Area Development Authority & Anr. v. M/s Steel Authority of India & Anr. Etc. 292. In K T Moopil Nair v. State of Kerala,373 Chief Justice B P Sinha observed that a tax on land or land revenue is assessed on the actual or potential productivity of the land sought to be taxed. The decision noted that a tax has reference to the income actually made or which could have been made. Thus, the principle emanating from this decision is that a tax under Entry 49 of List II may be levied on the actual or potential productivity of the land. In State of Kerala v. Haji K Kutty Naha,374 there was a challenge to the Kerala Buildings Act 1961 which levied tax on buildings in the state based on the floor area. This Court observed that the legislature did not take into consideration factors such as the class to which the building belonged, the nature of construction, the purpose for which it was used, its situation and capacity for profitable user and other relevant circumstances which had a bearing on matters of taxation. It was held that the statute was unconstitutional for treating dissimilar objects similarly. Haji K Kutty Naha (supra) recognized that a tax on lands and buildings must be measured by taking into consideration relevant factors related to the use of the lands or buildings.375 293. In Spencer & Co. (supra), the validity of a property tax assessed at 0.4 percent of the market value was challenged before this Court. It was urged that the levy of the property tax on vacant lands was unconstitutional because it was levied without any relation to the actual or potential income of the land. The Constitution Bench rejected the contention on the grounds that the market value of the land always bears a “definite relationship” to the actual or potential income being derived or derivable from the land. 294. The measure for taxing land may bear a reasonable relationship to the actual or potential productivity of land.
