Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 – Banking Regulation Act, G 1949 – Reserve Bank of India (Frauds Classification and Reporting by Commercial Banks and Select FIs) Directions 2016 – Principle of Natural Justice – Civil consequences to borrowers – Whether the classification of a borrower’s account as fraudulent under the Master Directions on Frauds entails civil consequences to borrowers – Held: Clause 8.12 of the Master Directions on Frauds H 476 STATE BANK OF INDIA & ORS v. RAJESH AGARWAL & ORS 477 deals with the penal measures for borrowers – Clause 8.12.1 A provides that penal provisions as applicable to wilful defaulters would apply to fraudulent borrowers, including the promoters and directors of the borrower company – In addition, borrowers are also liable to suffer the following consequences under the Master Directions on Frauds : a) No restructuring may be made in the case B of an RFA or fraud accounts (clause 8.12.2); b) No compromise on settlement involving a fraudulent borrower is allowed unless the conditions stipulate that the criminal complaint will be continued (clause 8.12.3) – The classification of a borrower’s account as fraud under the Master Directions on Frauds has difficult civil consequences for the borrower – Classification of the borrower’s C account as fraud under the Master Directions on Frauds virtually leads to a credit freeze for the borrower, who is debarred from raising finance from financial markets and capital markets – The bar from raising finances could be fatal for the borrower leading to its ‘civil death’ in addition to the infraction of their rights under Article D 19(1)(g) of the Constitution – Since, debarring disentitles a person or entity from exercising their rights and/or privileges, it is elementary that the principles of natural justice should be made applicable and the person against whom an action of debarment is sought should be given an opportunity of being heard.
