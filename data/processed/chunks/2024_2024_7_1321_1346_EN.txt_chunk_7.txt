22. The High Court, vide an interim dated 03.08.2007, directed the State to pay forthwith the retiral dues admissible to Respondent No. 1, excepting the amount which was paid in excess to him. It is the specific case of the State that this was duly complied with. 23. The High Court kept the above stated 2007 writ petition pending so as to await the outcome of the first round of litigation. Meanwhile, when the State issued the 2011 , the Respondents once again approached the High Court vide Writ A No. 44344/2011 (hereinafter, ‘2011 Writ’), challenging the 2011 while also seeking directions for the grant of pay scale of 7500-12000 with effect from 01.01.1996 and consequential payment of arrears. The High Court then clubbed together the Writ Petitions of 2007 and 2011. [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1333 State of Uttar Pradesh and Anr. v. Virendra Bahadur Katheria and Ors. 24. A Learned Single Judge of the High Court vide judgement dated 02.02.2018 allowed both the writ petitions, quashed the 2011 and directed the State to pass appropriate s within a period of three months (hereinafter, ‘Single Judge Judgement’). The Learned Single Judge was of the view that the State had wrongfully made misrepresentations to this Court with an intent to nullify the benefits otherwise accrued in favour of the Respondents. 25. The State Government, who until then was so vigorously pursuing the lis, for reasons which are still unbeknownst to us, went into a state of slumber. Neither did the State challenge the Single Judge’s dictum through an intra-court appeal within a reasonable time, nor did it take any conscious decision to honour and implement the said Judgement. 26. The State authorities, therefore, invited the initiation of contempt proceedings, which the Respondents filed alleging willful disobedience of the Single Judge Judgement, referred to above. Thereafter, on 23.05.2019, the State authorities woke up and filed an inordinately delayed Special Appeal Defective No. 532/2019 before the Division Bench of the High Court, challenging the Single Judge Judgement. 27. The High Court, first in its dated 10.01.2023 in Contempt proceedings directed the compliance of the Single Judge’s Judgement within 15 days.

The State then approached this Court against the High Court’s s dated 10.01.2023 and 07.02.2023. This Court, vide the dated 13.02.2023, stayed the effect of the abovementioned s, keeping in abeyance the contempt proceedings until further s. It was, 1334 [2024] 7 S.C.R.
