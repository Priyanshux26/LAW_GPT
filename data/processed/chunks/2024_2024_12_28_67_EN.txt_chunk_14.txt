Digital Supreme Court Reports transparency, and predictability to avoid being regarded as arbitrary and therefore violative of Article 14.” (C) K. MANJUSREE IS NOT AT VARIANCE WITH EARLIER PRECEDENTS 18. In K. Manjusree (supra) the recruitment exercise was for selection and appointments to the posts of District & Sessions Judges (Grade II). The extant rules prescribed the eligibility qualifications but were silent on the procedure for selection. The manner and method of selection was therefore to be decided by the High Court for every selection as and when the vacancies were notified for selection. The vacancies were notified by the State Government. As per the advertisement for selection a written examination followed by an interview were to be held. By a resolution dated 30.11.2004, the Administrative Committee of the High Court resolved to conduct written examination for 75 marks and interview for 25 marks. It was also resolved that the minimum qualifying marks for the OC,20 BC,21 SC22 and ST23 candidates shall be as prescribed earlier. Following the High Court’s direction, written examination was held on 30.1.2005, and its results were declared on 24.2.2005 wherein 83 candidates were successful. Interviews were held in March 2006. Thereafter, the marks obtained by those 83 candidates were aggregated and a consolidated merit list was prepared in the of merit on the basis of the aggregate marks. The merit list inter alia contained marks secured in the written examinations out of 100; marks secured in the interview out of 25; and the total marks secured in the written examination and interview out of 125. Based on that list, the Administrative Committee approved the selection of ten candidates as per merit and reservation. However, the Full Court did not agree with the select list prepared. Consequently, the Chief Justice constituted a Committee of Judges for preparing a fresh list. The Committee recommended that in place of 100 marks for the written examination and 25 marks for the interview, the candidates should be evaluated with reference to 75 marks for the written examination and 25 marks 20 Open Category or Unreserved Category. 21 Backward Class Category. 22 Scheduled Caste Category. 23 Scheduled Tribe Category.

The Committee also recommended that the minimum pass percentage applied for the written examination to determine the eligibility of the candidates for appearance in the interview should also be applied for interview marks, and those who failed to secure such minimum marks in the interview should be considered as having failed. Based on the recommendation of the Committee, the minimum percentage for passing the written examination (i.e., 50% for OC, 40% for BC, and 35% for SC and ST) was applied for interview and, therefore, only those candidates who secured the minimum of 12.5 marks in OC, 10 marks in BC and 8.7 marks in SC and ST were considered as having succeeded in the interview.
