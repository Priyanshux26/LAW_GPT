Per hectare income of the farmer has also increased. There has also been a reduction in the usage of insecticide for bollworm damage from 24 sprays to 2-3 sprays in a season. Long term studies conducted by Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) on the impact of Bt cotton cultivating states has not reported any adverse effect on soil, microflora and animal health. *** GOVERNMENT OF INDIA MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE RAJYA SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION No.222 TO BE ANSWERED ON 18.12.2022 Conferment of herbicide tolerance to genetically modified mustard 222. SHRI ANEEL PRASAD HEGDE: Will the Minister of ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE be pleased to state: (a) whether the bar gene in parental lines and hybrid offspring of Delhi University’s GM mustard confers herbicide tolerance to genetically modified mustard plants, even as it is useful as a marker gene; (b) whether India has put into place regulatory protocols to specifically test for the safety of HT GM crops as opposed to any other GM crop, and whether the parental lines of DMH-11 and DMH-11 itself have been tested for this herbicide tolerance trait, even if only for seed production purposes; and (c) if not, the reason thereof? [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2129 Gene Campaign & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors. ANSWER MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY) (a) to (c) The bar gene in Mustard hybrid DMH-11 is expressed which encodes phosphinothricin N-acetyl transferase enzyme that confers resistant to herbicide glufosinate ammonium. Genetically Modified (GM) Hybrid Mustard DMH-11 has not been approved for Herbicide Tolerant (HT) trait but for a GM technology for hybrid seed production. The HT characteristic/ trait present in the GM Mustard hybrid seed is essential for eliminating fertile plants that are not transgenic in the hybrid seed production plots to maintain the purity of hybrid seed. The use of herbicide will be limited to seed production stage by the seed producing company/institute and not during the commercial cultivation of DMH-11 by the farmers. The use of herbicide will be after obtaining label claim and approval from Central Insecticide Board and Registration Committee (CIB&RC). The biosafety research trials including environmental safety studies have been conducted for transgenic mustard hybrid DMH- 11 containing barnase, barstar and bar genes, events bn 3.6 (Barnase line) and modbs 2.99 (Barstarline). The issue of environmental release of GM Mustard is under adjudication in the Writ Petition (Civil) 115/2004 and Writ Petition (Civil) 260 of 2005 titled as Gene Campaign vs. UoI & Ors. and Aruna Rodrigues vs. UoI & Ors., respectively before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. (underlining by us) 2130 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 47.1 It is needless to observe that taking note of the said questions and answers so as to appreciate the stance of the Government at the particular point of time would be in line with the constitutional scheme in general and the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) (‘Rajya Sabha Rules’).
