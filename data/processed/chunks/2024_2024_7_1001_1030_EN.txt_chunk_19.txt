In 25 Anand Buttons Ltd. v. State of Haryana, (2005) 9 SCC 164, para 13. 1028 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports some cases, reversal of small pockets of land might be impossible also since they may lie in the middle of large development projects. In such peculiar circumstances, even if we accept that a handful of respondents did not get a fair enquiry under Section 5A, the same may not be a sufficient ground to annul the acquisition process as substantial compliance has already been made. 53. In Anand Singh v. State of U.P.,26 this Court held that: “56. In the written submissions of the GDA, it is stated that subsequent to the declaration made under Section 6 of the Act in the month of December 2004, award has been made and out of the 400 landowners more than 370 have already received compensation. It is also stated that out of the total cost of Rs. 8,85,14,000 for development of the acquired land, an amount of Rs. 5,28,00,000 has already been spent by the GDA and more than 60% of work has been completed. It, thus, seems that barring the appellants and few others all other tenure- holders/landowners have accepted the “takings” of their land. It is too late in the day to undo what has already been done. We are of the opinion, therefore, that in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, the appellants are not entitled to any relief although dispensation of enquiry under Section 5-A was not justified.” [emphasis supplied] Somewhat similar view has been taken by this Court in Om Prakash v. State of U.P.27 and M.S.P.L. Ltd. v. State of Karnataka.28 D.2.3. Issuance of the corrigendum 54. Lastly, the High Court has held that the Collector wrongly issued a corrigendum to its previous on 03.07.2014, which had raised suspicion on the fairness of the proceedings. A perusal of the corrigendum, however, suggests that it was largely insignificant as it merely contained the record of proceedings held before the hearing 26 [2010] 9 SCR 133 : (2010) 11 SCC 242, para 56. 27 [1998] 3 SCR 643 : (1998) 6 SCC 1, para 30. 28 [2022] 14 SCR 591 : 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1380, para 48. [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1029 New Okhla Industrial Development Authority v. Darshan Lal Bohra & Ors. on 03.07.2014. The corrigendum mentioned that the proceedings were postponed on 10.02.2014 since the decision on the implementation of the 2013 Act was awaited. Subsequently, after the proceedings were adjourned on multiple dates, the matter was finally posted for hearing on 03.07.2014. 55. It appears that the only purpose of the corrigendum was to bring further clarity into the ongoing process and not to tinker with the merits of the objections. There is nothing in the contents of the corrigendum to draw adverse inference or doubt the fairness of the procedure followed for deciding the objections. E. Conclusion and Directions 56.
