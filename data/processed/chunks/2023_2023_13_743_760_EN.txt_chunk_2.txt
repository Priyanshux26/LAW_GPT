RELEVANT FACTS GIVING RISE TO THE APPEAL 3. The appeal has its genesis in a proceeding for acquisition of land. It is noticed from the materials on record that the Reference Court in LAC No. 198/08, vide its dated 31st October 2008, enhanced compensation payable to the landowners. Such was sought to be challenged by the fi rst respondent in an appeal before the High Court on 2nd June 2010, numbered as LA. App. No. 655/2010. Since the appeal was time barred (delayed by 479 days), the fi rst respondent applied for condonation of delay. 4. After considering the pleadings as well as the other materials on record, the High Court was satisfi ed that the fi rst respondent, as the appellant, had shown suffi cient cause for which it could not present the appeal within time; hence, vide the impugned , it proceeded to allow C.M. No. 11018/2010. The delay of 479 days in presentation of the appeal was condoned but not without the High Court imposing costs of Rs. 10,000/- on the fi rst respondent. 5. The explanation put forth by the fi rst respondent, which ultimately found favour with the High Court, reveals the lamentable institutional ineffi ciency and the deplorable bureaucratic inertia. 6. The following events in the aftermath of the of the Reference Court need to be briefl y mentioned. Counsel who represented the fi rst respondent before the Reference Court applied for the certifi ed copy of the Reference Court’s on 22nd April 2009, despite the same being passed on 31st October 2008. Thereafter, certifi ed copy was received on 30th July 2009. On 10th August 2009, the Deputy Legal Advisor (Land and Building) advised the fi rst respondent to fi le an appeal before the High Court. The SHEO RAJ SINGH (DECEASED) THROUGH LRS. 747 & ORS. V. UNION OF INDIA & ANR. [DIPANKAR DATTA, J.] Principal Secretary (Land and Building) then approved the proposal for fi ling the appeal on 11th August 2009 (erroneously mentioned as 2010 in the application for condonation delay before the High Court). The Deputy Legal Advisor (Land and Building) thereafter sent the certifi ed copy and the approval of the Principal Secretary to the Deputy Commissioner (East) on 26th August 2009, which was received on 28th August 2009, whereupon the case fi le reached the Land Acquisition Collector on 31st August 2009. The case fi le was next forwarded to the counsel for the fi rst respondent for preparation of the appeal on 17th September 2009, and the same was sent back to the fi rst respondent on 7th October 2009. The fi le for payment of the requisite court fee of Rs. 51,36,592/- was put up before the relevant Deputy Commissioner on 12th October 2009. Subsequently, the budget for the same was sanctioned on 15th December 2009. The certifi ed copy of the of the Reference Court, in the meanwhile, was misplaced necessitating another application for the same which was made on 24th October 2009. Pursuant thereto, certifi ed copy was received on 3rd November 2009; thereafter the Accounts Department, on 12th January 2010, sent the case fi le to the Finance Department for the requisite funds.
