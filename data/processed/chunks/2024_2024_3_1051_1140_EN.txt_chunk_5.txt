Note: Pagination as per the original . [2024] 3 S.C.R. 1059 Union of India v. M/s Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. 844-848, and 850-855 respectively of 2014, by which the High Court allowed all the abovementioned appeals filed by the respondent herein (original appellant) and directed the railway administration to refund the difference of approx.. 110 km that was illegally levied towards the freight charges. A. FACTUAL MATRIX 2. The respondent company herein had booked various consignments of furnace oil between the years 2002 & 2005 via railway from Baad to Hisar route. Indisputably the freight for the same was calculated by the appellant on the basis of a total chargeable distance of 444 km. as per the then prevailing distance table plying for the said route. 3. On 07.04.2004, the Ministry of Railways vide its Letter No. TCR/2043/2002/2, decided to rationalize the method of calculating the ‘chargeable distance’ between the pairs of station routes by way of rounding off the aggregate of the ‘actual engineering distance’ to the next higher kilometre only once at the end.
