H 360 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 8 S.C.R. A Part-V: Appeals by persons whose impleadment applications were dismissed by the High Court, but whose cases are similar to that of the claim petitioners 178. As many as 24 impleadment applications were dismissed by B the Division Bench of the High Court in the impugned , on the ground, that no third party can implead in a claim petition filed by somebody else and that the only remedy of such parties is to file separate claim petitions. 179. All the 24 impleadment applications fall under different C categories namely: (i) those claiming to be in possession of a portion of the land representing the half share purportedly purchased by Cyrus/ Goldstone/Trinity in Survey No.172 of Hydernagar; (ii) those who claim to be in possession of a part of the land in D the other half of Survey No.172 of Hydernagar; (iii) those who claim to be in possession of lands in other survey numbers; (iv) the Asset Reconstruction Company which claims to be the E mortgagee; and (iv) those who filed applications for impleadment in OSA No.59 of 2004. 180. Out of the aforesaid categories of persons whose impleadment applications were dismissed, the case of the Asset Reconstruction F Company has been dealt with by us in the next part of the . 181. Insofar as the other persons whose impleadment applications were dismissed are concerned, we do not know why they consider themselves to be affected by the impugned . In paragraph 414(e) of the impugned , the Division Bench of the High Court has G held the entire of the previous Bench dated 23.06.2006 to be void as a consequence of this Court setting aside the same on the principle of coram non judice. In paragraph 414(f), the High Court had declared the entire preliminary decree as regards the lands in Hydernagar village (not confined to any particular survey number) as void ab initio. In paragraph 414(g), the dated 20.01.1984 in Application H M/s TRINITY INFRAVENTURES LTD. & ORS. ETC. v. M. S. 361 MURTHY & ORS. ETC. [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] No.266 of 1983 and the dated 28.12.1995 in Application A No.994 of 1995, have been held to be inexecutable not only against the claim petitioners but also against third parties. In paragraph 414(h), the High Court has declared even the final decree to be null and void. In paragraph 414(i), the dated 29.03.1996 in EP No.3 of 1996 passed by the District Court and the Bailiff’s Report dated B 19.04.1996 have been held to be non-existent and null and void not only as against the claim petitioners but also as against any third party. In other words, despite the dismissal of the impleadment applications, the High Court has protected the interest of persons against whom the decree is sought to be executed. In any case, those persons who have identical claim as the obstructionists, who have filed C independent appeals against the impugned will have the benefit of the .
