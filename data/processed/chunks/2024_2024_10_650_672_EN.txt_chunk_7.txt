However, the Court found that in such cases the principle enunciated in the case of B.S. Joshi and others v. State of Haryana and another8 should be applied. 20. This Court specifically noted that though it is alleged that certain documents had been created by the appellant therein to avail of credit facilities beyond the limit to which the Company was entitled, the power of quashing could be exercised. This Court found that in view of a compromise arrived at between the Company and the Bank, it was a fit case where a technicality should not be allowed to stand in the way of quashing of the criminal proceedings. This Court found that in view of the settlement arrived at between the parties, continuance of the same would be an exercise in futility. 21. A similar view was again taken by 2 Judge Bench of this Court in the case of Manoj Sharma v. State and others.9 22. However, another 2 Judge Bench of this Court in the case of Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another10 doubted the correctness of the view taken by this Court in the cases of B.S. Joshi (supra), Nikhil Merchant (supra), and Manoj Sharma (supra) and referred the matter to a larger Bench. 23. The reference was answered by the learned 3 Judge Bench of this Court in the case of Gian Singh (supra).11 Speaking for the Bench, R.M. Lodha, J. (as His Lordship then was), observed thus: 8 [2003] 2 SCR 1104 : (2003) 4 SCC 675 9 [2008] 14 SCR 539 : (2008) 16 SCC 1 10 [2012] 8 SCR 753 : (2010) 15 SCC 118 11 [2012] 8 SCR 753 : (2012) 10 SCC 303 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 661 K. Bharthi Devi and Anr. v. State of Telangana and Anr. “57. Quashing of offence or criminal proceedings on the ground of settlement between an offender and victim is not the same thing as compounding of offence. They are different and not interchangeable. Strictly speaking, the power of compounding of offences given to a court under Section 320 is materially different from the quashing of criminal proceedings by the High Court in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction. In compounding of offences, power of a criminal court is circumscribed by the provisions contained in Section 320 and the court is guided solely and squarely thereby while, on the other hand, the formation of opinion by the High Court for quashing a criminal offence or criminal proceeding or criminal complaint is guided by the material on record as to whether the ends of justice would justify such exercise of power although the ultimate consequence may be acquittal or dismissal of indictment. 58. Where the High Court quashes a criminal proceeding having regard to the fact that the dispute between the offender and the victim has been settled although the offences are not compoundable, it does so as in its opinion, continuation of criminal proceedings will be an exercise in futility and justice in the case demands that the dispute between the parties is put to an end and peace is restored; securing the ends of justice being the ultimate guiding factor.
