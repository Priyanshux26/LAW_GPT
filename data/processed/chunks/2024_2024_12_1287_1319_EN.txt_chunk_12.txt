State Government was also called upon to produce records and documents depicting grant of TDR certificates in terms of the of this Court as well as the of the High Court. However, the State Government instead of complying with the s passed by this Court and the High Court and initially having made a show of its earnestness to comply with the , had submitted before the High Court in Writ Petition No. 6585 of 2020 on 17.02.2021 through the learned Advocate General that it would move this Court seeking modification of the dated 21.11.2014. Thus, Government came to be issued on 23.02.2021 wherein it has been stated that State Cabinet had decided to resile from its earlier decisions taken on 11.07.2019 vide Subject No. C435/2019 (pursuant to which the State Government had issued Government dated 17.07.2019 bearing No. MA.AA. EE.-MNY/2018 permitting issuance of TDR) and had resolved to file 4 [2014] 1 SCR 538 : 2014 (16) SCC 204 para 12 [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1305 Chaduranga Kanthraj Urs and Anr. v. P. Ravi Kumar and Ors. an application for modification of the dated 21.11.2014 and pursuant to the decision so taken, I.A. No. 98276 of 2021 came to be filed in C.A. No. 3303 of 1997 and connected appeals by the State of Karnataka on 12.08.2021 as already noted hereinabove. The present contempt petitions came to be filed on 17.08.2021 and this Court by dated 03.01.2022 directed the listing of these contempt petitions along with I.A. No. 98276 of 2021 filed for modification of the dated 21.11.2014. Said application came to be heard and disposed of by this Court by dated 17.05.2022 by rejecting the same as already noticed herein above. Atleast then s dated 21.11.2014 and 17.05.2022 ought to have been implemented. However, the Respondents seem to have dragged their feet and for no justifiable reason whatsoever have not implemented the said s. Thus, explicitly there has been wilful disobedience of s of this Court and respondents having failed in their attempt to seek modification of dated 21.11.2014 cannot take umbrage under any circumstances whatsoever for not implementing the s of this Court, particularly when clarification/modification prayer was put to rest on 17.05.2022 by this Court. 10. The wilful disobedience of the s of this Court, at this stage is manifest and for no reason whatsoever it can be construed that respondents were under any doubt or there was lack of clarity in the s of this Court. Infact the dated 21.11.2014 is clear and explicit. However, under the guise of implementation of said would result in grant of TDR to the extent of Rs. 1396 crores (the value of which is in serious dispute) modification was sought and said attempt made after Seven (7) years had also failed. This Court in the matter of All Bengal Excise Licensees Association v/s Raghabendra Singh and Others5 has taken a view that disobedience in a particular case would be continued as wilful based on facts and circumstances unfolded in a given case.
