The in Shyoraj Singh is set aside as it does not lay down good law and was passed while overlooking at the earlier precedents, rendering it per incuriam. 39. The High Court while deciding Kamal Sharma extensively considered the factual matrix and also examined the original records of the State Government to arrive at the satisfaction that the invocation of the urgency clause was absolutely justified with regard to the acquisition in question. The High Court also exhaustively considered the entire [2024] 11 S.C.R. 1097 Kali Charan and Others v. State of U.P. and Others sequence of judicial pronouncements in respect of the acquisition in question before arriving at the aforesaid conclusion and acted in an equitable manner while affirming the acquisition proceedings and directing the grant of additional compensation. We appreciate the endeavour made by the High Court to resolve the controversy objectively and equitably and grant our full imprimatur to the in Kamal Sharma. 40. Now, we are called upon to consider as to whether the escalated compensation formula as arrived at by the Division Bench of the High Court in the case of Kamal Sharma would subserve the ends of justice or the landowners whose lands have been acquired would be entitled to better compensation. 41. It is pertinent to note that the overwhelming majority of landowners have refrained from seeking judicial intervention in this matter, as manifested by the fact that only 140 out of 12,868 landowners(covered in both batches of civil appeals @ special leave petitions) have opted to challenge the acquisition by approaching this Court. This indicates that the majority of the landowners have accepted the escalated compensation granted by the High Court in Kamal Sharma. 42. This Court, in the cases of Savitri Devi v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others,33 Sahara India Commercial Corporation Limited and Others v. State of Uttar Pradesh,34 and Noida Industrial Development Authority v. Ravindra Kumar and Others,35 despite holding the invocation of the urgency clause under Sections 17(1) and 17(4) of the Act to be illegal, nonetheless upheld the acquisition proceedings and directed enhancement of compensation so as to compensate the land owners. However, in the present case, we have concluded that the action of the State in invocation of the urgency clause is in consonance with the law. 43. The Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court, while delivering its decision in Kamal Sharma has already granted additional compensation of 64.7% to the landowners, to be offered as ‘No Litigation Bonus’ in consonance with the Government dated 4th 33 [2015] 7 SCR 512 : (2015) 7 SCC 21 34 (2017) 11 SCC 339 35 [2022] 1 SCR 1113 : (2022) 13 SCC 468 1098 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports November, 2015, thus there is no scope to direct further enhancement in compensation. 44. In light of the Government dated 4th November, 2015 and the precedents set in Savitri Devi v. State of Uttar Pradesh36 and Yamuna Expressway Industrial Authority v. Shakuntla Education and Welfare Society,37 it is directed that 64.7% enhancement in compensation shall apply in rem, ensuring uniform benefits to all affected landowners under the present land acquisition.
