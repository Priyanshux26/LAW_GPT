Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, “debt of other liability” means a legally enforceable debt or other liability.” 130 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 13. This Court in ICDS Ltd. v. Beena Shabeer and Another,2 has held that proceedings under Section 138 of the NI Act 1881 can be initiated even if the cheque was originally issued as security and was subsequently dishonoured owing to insufficient funds. The failure to honour the concerned cheque is per se deemed as a commission of an offence under Section 138 of the NI Act 1881. 14. The NI Act 1881 enlists three essential conditions that ought to be fulfilled before the said provision of law can be invoked. Firstly, the cheque ought to have been presented within the period of its validity. Secondly, a demand of payment ought to have been made by the presenter of the cheque to the issuer, and lastly, the drawer ought to have had failed to pay the amount within a period of 15 days of the receipt of the demand. These principles and pre-requisites stand well established through of this Court in Sadanandan Bhadran v. Madhavan Sunil Kumar.3 There is an explicit limitation of 30 days, beginning from period when the cause of action arose, prescribed by the statute vide Section 142(b) of the NI Act 1881 to initiate proceedings under Section 138 of the NI Act 1881. 15. Furthermore, this Court expounded that the issuance of cheque towards a liability, the presentation of the cheque within the prescribed period, its return on account of dishonour, notice to the accused, and failure to pay within 15 days thereof, stand as sine qua non for an offence under Section 138 of the NI Act 1881 as per the decision in K. Bhaskaran v. Sankaran Vaidhyan Balan and Another.4 The same was subsequently reiterated in numerous s of this Court as well as that of the High Courts. 16. While referring to the period of limitation of one month of filing a complaint for the purpose of Section 138 of the NI Act 1881, the same is to begin after the drawer of the cheque has failed to discharge his liability to the presenter within the prescribed period of 15 days as per the Proviso (c) to Section 138 of the NI Act 1881. A co-joint reading of Sections 138 and 142 of the NI Act 1881 makes it clear that the cause of action only arises after the failure of the drawer to pay, subsequent to the receipt of the notice, and the complainant is 2 [2002] Supp. 1 SCR 488 : (2002) 6 SCC 426. 3 [1998] Supp. 1 SCR 178 : (1998) 6 SCC 514. 4 [1999] Supp. 3 SCR 271 : (1999) 7 SCC 510. [2024] 8 S.C.R. 131 Sri Dattatraya v. Sharanappa restricted from initiating multiple complaints against the concerned drawer at different stages contemplated prior. 17. Furthermore, in light of such object encapsulated in the Amendment to Chapter VIII, the Parliament by virtue of Section 143 of the NI Act 1881 prescribed procedure of summary trial enlisted in provisions of Sections 260 to 265 of the CrPC 1973 to be adopted during proceedings under Section 138 of the NI Act 1881.
