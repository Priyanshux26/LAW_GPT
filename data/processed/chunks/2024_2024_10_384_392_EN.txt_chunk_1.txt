The appeal before the NCLAT, Chennai was filed on 2 December 2023.

India Power Corporation Limited 5. A divergence arose between the two members of the NCLAT on 1 May 2024. The Judicial Member held that the certified copy which was filed by the appellant was a “free of cost” copy and hence in the absence of an application for the grant of a certified copy, the delay of three days could not be condoned. The Technical Member, on the other hand, held that no distinction could be made between certified copies obtained through the payment of fee and a free copy and sufficient cause was shown for condoning the delay of three days. 6. The divergence was, thereafter, referred to a third Member of the NCLAT who has ruled that the free copy provided under Rule 50 of the National Company Law Tribunal Rules 20164 cannot be treated as a certified copy which is referred to in Rule 22(2) of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal Rules 2016.5 7.
