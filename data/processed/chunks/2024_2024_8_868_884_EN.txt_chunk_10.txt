This subsequent circular covered the castes such as Kotegara, Kotekshathriya, Koteyava, Koteyar, Ramakshathriya, Sherugara, and Sarvegara, thus, ensuring that individuals of these castes, holding Scheduled Castes Certificates issued prior to de-scheduling, would be entitled to claim protection of their services albeit as unreserved candidates for all future purposes. Additionally, the communication issued by the Ministry of Finance dated 17th August, 2005 reinforced the protective umbrella to the concerned bank employees and also saved them from departmental and criminal action. 36. There is an additional feature in Civil Appeals @ SLP(C) Nos. 23500- 23501 of 2019, that must be highlighted. The appellant, in the said appeals namely Smt. Hemavathy, contends that she secured 8th rank in the Bachelor of Engineering course with a specialization in Industrial Production from Mysore University in 1995. It was argued on her behalf that regardless of the Caste Certificate, the appellant would have secured a job at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited(hereinafter being referred to as ‘HAL’) based on her merit in engineering degree and that the show cause notice was issued as women employees are not welcome in the institution(HAL). This significant contention raised by the appellant has not been adequately traversed by the respondent-HAL in their counter affidavit. 884 [2024] 8 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 37. Consequently, we hold that the proposed action of the respondent banks/undertakings in issuing notice(s) to the appellants to show cause as to why their services may not be terminated cannot be sustained and are hereby quashed. 38. As a result, the impugned s rendered by the Division Bench do not stand to scrutiny, and hence, the same are quashed and set aside. 39. The appeals are accordingly allowed in these terms. No costs. 40. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeals allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Divya Pandey
