AHMAD ALI KHAN AND 963 OTHERS [K. M. JOSEPH, J.] in 1969 would be in time. It is contended on behalf of the A respondents that the correct Article to apply is Article 96 of the new Limitation Act. On the other hand, it is contended on behalf of the appellant that Article 65 of the new Limitation Act is the governing Article. The applicability of either Art. 65 or Art. 96 would depend on whether the transfer was void ab B initio or only voidable. xxx xxx xxx 10. An alienation made in contravention of a statutory provision which is enacted in public interest is void. Admittedly the permanent leases were granted in violation of Section 58(1) C which prohibits grant of lease for more than five years without prior sanction. The transfer by permanent leases is, therefore, void. We are fortified in this view by the earlier decisions of this Court. In the case of Naba Kishore Panda v. Bulendra, (1974-40 Cut LT 1152), referred to above, Hon’ble S.K. Ray, D J. (as he then was) held that a permanent lease created in express breach of the mandatory provisions of S. 58(1) is void. In a subsequent Single Bench decision in the case of Arjuna Jena v. Chaitanya Thakur (1978) 45 Cut LT 461, Hon’ble B.K. Ray, J. also held that a lease created in violation of the provisions of Section 58(1) of the old Act is a void one. For this E proposition, his Lordship relied on an earlier Division Bench decision of this Court in the case of Shri Chiranjilal Patwari v. Commr., Hindu Religious Endowments, Orissa, Bhubaneswar (1974) 40 Cut LT 41. In another Single Bench decision of this Court in the case of Gulam Ali Saha v. Sultan F Khan, (1966) 32 Cut LT 510 : (AIR 1967 Orissa 55), decided by Hon’ble G.K. Misra, J. (as he then was) the question of validity of an alienation of wakf property without permission of the Court came up for consideration and it was held that the alienation, even though for consideration, was void ab initio. It was further held, relying on the principles laid down by the G Privy Council in Masjid Shahid Ganj v. S.G.P. Committee, Amritsar, AIR 1940 PC 116, that Article 144 of the old Limitation Act applies to such a case for acquisition of title by adverse possession. In an unreported decision of this Court in Second Appeal No. 361 of 1966 disposed of on 3rd August, 1970 H 964 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A (Sambari Bewa v. Orissa Board of Wakfs) Hon’ble R.N. Misra, J. (as he then was) considered the validity of an alienation made by a Mutwalli in violation of the provisions of Section 36-A of the Wakf Act and came to hold that a permanent lease granted in violation of the provisions of the Wakf Act is ab initio void (vide para. 8).” B 6. Thereafter, the Court posed a question, as to whether it was Article 65 or Article 96, which applied.
