The Court also examined the legislative intent behind the 1994 amendment to Section 10, noting that while the amendment introduced the term “transport vehicle” under Section 10(2)(e), it did not amend the definition of LMVs under Section 2(21). It was further observed that the newly inserted provision of Section 10(2)(e) would only subsume those classes of vehicles that were contained in Sections 10(2)(e) to 10(2)(h) of the un-amended Act i.e. medium goods vehicle, medium passenger vehicle, heavy goods vehicle and 632 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports heavy passenger vehicle, and which now stand deleted by virtue of the amendment of 1994. Since no amendment was carried out in Section 10(2)(d) of the Act which contains the class for ‘Light Motor Vehicles’, the scope of Section 10(2)(d) would remain intact as is contained in Section 2(21) of the Act, which is to say that LMV would include ‘Transport Vehicles’ in cases where the gross weight of such vehicle is less than 7500 Kgs. It further noted that the syllabus does not provide separate training for transport vehicles but includes them under the relevant vehicle class based on the vehicle’s weight. It considered Rule 75 which deals with ‘State Register of motor vehicles’ as provided in Form 41. Form 41 categorizes vehicles on the basis of, inter alia, gross vehicle weight, unladen weight etc. Likewise, the Court observed that Section 41, pertaining to registration, mandates the inclusion of relevant information as specified in Form 20, which outlines details such as the class of vehicle, gross vehicle weight, and unladen weight, among other factors. 114. The court analysed those key provisions of the Act and Rules and reached a conclusion which is aligned with the discussion and opinion in this . It rightly concluded as under: "(i) ‘Light motor vehicle’ as defined in section 2(21) of the Act would include a transport vehicle as per the weight prescribed in section 2(21) read with section 2(15) and 2(48). Such transport vehicles are not excluded from the definition of the light motor vehicle by virtue of Amendment Act No.54/1994. (ii) A transport vehicle and omnibus, the gross vehicle weight of either of which does not exceed 7500 kg. would be a light motor vehicle and also motor car or tractor or a road roller, ‘unladen weight’ of which does not exceed 7500 kg. and holder of a driving licence to drive class of “light motor vehicle” as provided in section 10(2)(d) is competent to drive a transport vehicle or omnibus, the gross vehicle weight of which does not exceed 7500 kg. or a motor car or tractor or road-roller, the “unladen weight” of which does not exceed 7500 kg. That is to say, no separate endorsement on the licence is required to drive a transport vehicle of light motor [2024] 11 S.C.R. 633 M/s Bajaj Alliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Rambha Devi & Ors. vehicle class as enumerated above. A licence issued under section 10(2)(d) continues to be valid after Amendment Act 54/1994 and 28.3.2001 in the form.
