The proviso to Section 8(2) has been added to allow a party that does not possess the original or certifi ed copy of the arbitration agreement on account of it 286 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. being retained by the other party, to nevertheless apply under Section 8 seeking reference, and call upon the other party to produce the same.’ (Ref. : Justice R.S. Bachawat’s Law of Arbitration and Conciliation, Sixth Edn., Vol. I (Sections 1 to 34) at p. 695 published by Lexis Nexis). * * * 30. The language of amendment to Section 8 of the Act is clear that the amendment to Section 8(1) of the Act would apply notwithstanding any prayer, , decree or of the Supreme Court or any other court. The High Court laid [Ameet Lalchand Shah v. Rishabh Enterprises, 2017 SCC OnLine Del 7865] emphasis upon the word ‘… unless it fi nds that prima facie no valid agreement exists’. The High Court observed that there is no arbitration agreement between Astonfi eld and Rishabh. After referring to Sukanya Holdings [Sukanya Holdings (P) Ltd. v. Jayesh H. Pandya, (2003) 5 SCC 531] and the amended Section 8 and Section 45 of the Act, the High Court pointed out the diff erence in language of Section 8 and Section 45 of the Act. The High Court distinguished between Sukanya Holdings [Sukanya Holdings (P) Ltd. v. Jayesh H. Pandya, (2003) 5 SCC 531] and Chloro Controls [Chloro Controls (India) (P) Ltd. v. Severn Trent Water Purifi cation Inc., (2013) 1 SCC 641 : (2013) 1 SCC (Civ) 689] and observed that Sukanya Holdings [Sukanya Holdings (P) Ltd. v. Jayesh H. Pandya, (2003) 5 SCC 531] was not overruled by Chloro Controls [Chloro Controls (India) (P) Ltd. v. Severn Trent Water Purifi cation Inc., (2013) 1 SCC 641 : (2013) 1 SCC (Civ) 689].” 21. This Court ultimately held that the main purpose of bringing an amendment inter alia in Sections 8 and 11 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 was to minimise the scope of judicial authority, which was to refuse reference to arbitration only on the ground when it prima facie fi nds that there was no valid arbitration agreement. The legislative intent for the amendment was confi ned to limiting judicial intervention, and once the Court fi nds that there is a valid arbitration agreement, it has no option but to refer the matter for arbitration. But this would not mean that where the matter itself is non-arbitrable, or is covered by a special legislation such as the Consumer Protection Act, it still has to be referred for arbitration. In Para 59 of Emaar III (supra), it was stated as under: SMT. M. HEMALATHA DEVI & ORS. v. B. UDAYASRI 287 [SUDHANSHU DHULIA, J.] “59. The amendment in Section 8 cannot be given such expansive meaning and intent so as to inundate entire regime of special legislations where such disputes were held to be not arbitrable. Something which legislation never intended cannot be accepted as side wind to override the settled law.
