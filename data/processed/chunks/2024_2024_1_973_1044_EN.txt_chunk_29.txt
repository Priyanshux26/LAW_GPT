On the other hand, Shri Sajan Poovayya, learned Senior Counsel, appearing for the applicants, has fairly submitted that the applications were filed only against [2024] 1 S.C.R. 1015 The State of Himachal Pradesh and Others v. Yogendera Mohan Sengupta and Another the appellants in CAs Nos. 5016 and 8002-03 of 2016 (Respondents 9 and 10). He has no objection to set aside the insofar as the appellants in other appeals including the State of Karnataka are concerned. He has also no objection to set aside the general conditions and directions of NGT in para 1 of the dated 4-5-2016 [Forward Foundation v. State of Karnataka, 2016 SCC OnLine NGT 1409] except the directions issued against Respondents 9 and 10. In view of the above, it is not necessary to examine the contentions of the learned Advocate General in Civil Appeals Nos. 4923-24 of 2017. It is also not necessary to consider the contentions urged in the other civil appeals except the appeals filed by Respondents 9 and 10.” 73. It could thus be seen that this Court has specifically recorded the submissions made by the counsel that he has no objection if this Court sets aside the general conditions and directions of NGT in para 1 of the dated 4th May 2016 in the case of Forward Foundation v. State of Karnataka28, except the directions issued against Respondents 9 and 10. It could thus be seen that this Court, in view of the submissions recorded on behalf of the counsel for the applicants, did not find it necessary to consider the contentions urged in the other civil appeals except the appeals filed against Respondents 9 and 10. As such, the observations made in para 47 of Mantri Techzone Private Limited (supra) will have to be construed as restricted to the cases of respondent Nos. 9 and 10. The position is further clarified from the observations of this Court in the said case in paras 60-61. 74. As to what could be a binding precedent has been succinctly observed by this Court in the case of Union of India and Others v. Dhanwanti Devi and Others29, which reads as under: “9. ……It is not everything said by a Judge while giving that constitutes a precedent. The only thing in a Judge’s decision binding a party is the principle upon which the case is decided and for this reason it is important to 28 2016 SCC OnLine NGT 1409 29 [1996] 5 Suppl. SCR 32 : (1996) 6 SCC 44 : 1996 INSC 911 1016 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports analyse a decision and isolate from it the ratio decidendi. According to the well-settled theory of precedents, every decision contains three basic postulates—(i) findings of material facts, direct and inferential. An inferential finding of facts is the inference which the Judge draws from the direct, or perceptible facts; (ii) statements of the principles of law applicable to the legal problems disclosed by the facts; and (iii) based on the combined effect of the above.
