Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017) 10 SCC 1 (Privacy-9J.) 542 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of existence”.83 In that sense, human dignity is a constitutional value and a constitutional goal.84 56. The Court has authoritatively ruled, “[t]o live is to live with dignity”.85 Human dignity is intrinsic to and inseparable from human existence.86 Implicit in this right under Article 21 is “the right to protection against torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment”.87 There also exists “a close relationship between dignity and the quality of life”.88 Dignity of human existence is fully realized only when one leads a quality life.89 57. Dignity under Article 21 is an integral aspect of life, which requires sustenance of one’s being to the fullest.90 One can truly embrace their identity, whether on the basis of caste, race, gender, sexual orientation, or ethnicity, only if they are given dignity. An individual’s dignity is fundamental to their sense of self and autonomy. Thus, the right to dignity “encapsulates the right of every individual to be treated as a self-governing entity having intrinsic value”.91 Above all, “there is a growing recognition that the true measure of development of a nation is not economic growth; it is human dignity.”92 A nation must prioritize human dignity—ensuring that every person, regardless of their background or identity, is able to live with respect, equality, and freedom. Thus, human dignity forms the bedrock of social justice and a just, compassionate society. 58. The right to live with dignity extends even to the incarcerated. Not providing dignity to prisoners is a relic of the colonizers and pre- colonial mechanisms, where oppressive systems were designed to dehumanize and degrade those under the control of the State. Authoritarian regimes of the pre-constitutional era saw prisons not only as places of confinement but as tools of domination.

Constitution, has recognized that even prisoners are entitled to the right to dignity. 59. A Constitution bench of this Court in Sunil Batra (I) v. Delhi Administration93 took serious note of the treatment meted out to undertrials, convicts, and those awaiting the death penalty. Justice Krishna Iyer, in his opinion, expounded: “The humane thread of jail jurisprudence that runs right through is that no prison authority enjoys amnesty for unconstitutionality, and forced farewell to fundamental rights is an institutional outrage in our system where stone walls and iron bars shall bow before the rule of law.” He emphasized the need to re-look at the prison conditions: “A prison is a sound-proof planet, walled from view and visits regulated, and so, rights of prisoners are hardly visible, checking is more difficult and the official position of the repository of power inspires little credibility where the victims can be political protesters, unpopular figures, minority champions or artless folk who might fail to propitiate arrogant power of minor minions.” Justice Krishna Iyer advocated for a humane system within prisons: “In every country, this transformation from cruelty to compassion within jails has found resistance from the echelons and the Great Divide between pre-and-post Constitution penology has yet to get into the metabolism of the Prison Services.
