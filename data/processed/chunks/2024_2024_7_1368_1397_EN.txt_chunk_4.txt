It was also their case that Article 350 of U.P. Civil Service Regulations was amended by a Notification dated 20.04.1977 whereby the word ‘Post’ was replaced by the word ‘Establishment’ and as such employees of all establishments under the State Government are deemed to be working on a pensionable post unless the establishment is excluded. Therefore, on a conjoint reading of Government dated 28.10.1960 with the amendment made in the year 1977 in Article 350, the appellants are entitled to pension. 12. The appellants also relied on the in the matter of Mirza Athar Beg (supra), S.M. Fazil (supra) & Narain Pandey (supra). The main focus of the appellants’ claim is on the amendment to the Article 350 of the Regulations, after which, according to the appellants, Government has not issued any excluding the establishment in which the appellants were employed and holding a pensionable post. It is also argued that after the establishment of the Corporation under Section 3 of the Act, 1950, no rule or regulation has been framed in exercise of power under Section 44 denying pension to the appellants. Therefore, the general provisions under Article 350 of the Regulations would be applicable and the appellants are entitled for pension. 8 2009 : AHC-LKO : 3978-DB [2024] 7 S.C.R. 1375 U.P. Roadways Retired Officials and Officers Association v. State of U.P. & Anr. 13. Apropos the objection that the writ petition was filed belatedly, after decades from the date of retirement, it is submitted that the appellants have recurring cause of action and delay in filing the writ petition is not fatal. 14. Per contra, Ms Garima Prasad, learned senior counsel appearing for the Corporation vehemently argued that all the appellants have already opted for and availed the post-retiral benefits under the Employees Provident Fund Scheme, therefore, their present claim preferred after huge delay ranging between 8 to 32 years has rightly been dismissed by the High Court. Reference is made to Union of India & Ors. Vs. M.K. Sarkar .9 15. Ms. Prasad would distinguish the fact situation in the matters of Mirza Athar Beg (supra), S.M. Fazil (supra) & Narain Pandey (supra) by pointing out that in these cases the High Court has not considered the effect of Note 3 of Article 350 of the Regulations which has neither been amended nor deleted even by the amendment dated 20.04.1977. It is further submitted that the Roadways was an establishment having workshops both major and smaller, thus, included in the category of technical institution as has been held by the Allahabad High Court in the rendered in Bachai Lal v. U. P. S. R. T. C., Allahabad and others.10 The Roadways is also an industry according to the test prescribed in the matter of General Manager, Telecom vs. A. Srinivasa Rao & Ors.11 Therefore, the non-gazetted post in the Roadways did not qualify for pension in view of Note 3 of Article 350 of the Regulations. It is then argued that the service conditions of employees of the Roadways as existing prior to their absorption in the Corporation were never protected by GO dated 05.07.1972 under which the appellants are not entitled for pension as they have never worked on any pensionable post as indicated in para 1 of GO dated 28.10.1960 till their absorption in the Corporation w.e.f 28.04.1982.
