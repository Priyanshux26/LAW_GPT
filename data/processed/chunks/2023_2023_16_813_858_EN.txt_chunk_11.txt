Not only that, 531 posts of Post Code 556, which remained unfi lled, and, therefore, carried forward, and re-advertised on 21.09.2020, were to be segregated and fi lled in terms of the direction above. In consequence, the number of posts advertised under the advertisement dated 21.09.2020 were to get reduced to that extent. However, as per the decision of the High Court, the candidates who professed holding qualifi cations higher than the one prescribed were not to get any benefi t as that issue already stood concluded vide and of the High Court dated 29.08.2019, passed in Writ Petition No.161 of 2019, against which SLP (C) No.45 of 2021 was dismissed by this Court. Appeals Before This Court 12. (A) Arising out of SLP (C) No. 730 of 2022: This appeal questions the direction given in paragraph 33 of the impugned . The appellants herein claim that they hold the requisite eligibility qualifi cations prescribed by the 2014 Rules as well as the advertisement; they participated in the recruitment exercise for Post Code 556 and were placed in the merit-list; if candidates who were otherwise not eligible, but for the relaxation, are permitted to be considered, as directed in paragraph 33, the merit-list might have to be re-drawn and they may be ousted and replaced by those who, otherwise, were ineligible. These appellants have, therefore, prayed that the direction given by the High Court in paragraph 33 of the impugned be quashed and the earlier merit-list be not disturbed. 832 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. In this appeal, intervention / impleadment application(s) (i.e., I.A. Nos. 30862 of 2022; 26627 of 2022; and 73507 of 2022) have been fi led by such candidates who were to benefi t by the direction given in paragraph 33 of the impugned . Another I.A. No 14524 of 2022 has been fi led for impleading parties who had put in appearance through various intervention applications. Yet another I.A. No. 5062 of 2022 has been fi led to bring on record: (a) a copy of letter issued by the Director of Higher Education, Govt. of Himachal Pradesh; (b) copy of the of the High Court dated 29.08.2019 passed in Writ Petition Nos. 629 of 2019 and 161 of 2019; and (c) copy of the dated 15.11.2021 passed by this Court in SLP (C) No. 45 of 2021 whereby Special Leave Petition preferred against the of the High Court dated 29.08.2019 was dismissed. (B) Arising out of SLP (C) No. 729 of 2022: This appeal is also at the instance of those candidates who were considered and selected under the second advertisement for Post Code 556. They are, therefore, similarly aggrieved as the appellants of appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 730 of 2022. In this appeal, too, an Impleadment Application No. 15047 of 2022 has been fi led to bring on record parties who had put in appearance through various intervention applications.
