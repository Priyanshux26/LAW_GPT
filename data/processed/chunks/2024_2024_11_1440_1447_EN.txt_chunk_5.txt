[2024] 11 S.C.R. 1447 Sunny @ Santosh Dharmu Bhosale v. The State of Maharashtra 18. As already discussed hereinabove, the prosecution has utterly failed to prove any case of premeditation. On the contrary, the case as put forth by the prosecution is about the appellant coming to the house of Rajendra Bhosale (PW-5), abusing him and his wife Chayya, and the weapon used is a bamboo stick which is commonly available anywhere in the village. The nature of the injuries sustained by the deceased would also not show that the appellant had taken any undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. 19. In that view of the matter, we find that the appellant is entitled to benefit of doubt. The conviction of the appellant under Section 302 IPC, therefore, deserves to be altered to one under Part I of Section 304 IPC. 20. We are, therefore, inclined to partly allow the present appeal. 21. In the result, we pass the following : (i) The appeal is partly allowed. (ii) The conviction of the appellant under Section 302 IPC is altered to the one under Part I of Section 304 IPC. (iii) The appellant has already undergone actual imprisonment for a period of more than 9 years and with remission he has undergone the sentence of more than 12 years prior to his release on bail by the of this Court dated 4th October 2024. We, therefore, find that the said sentence would subserve the ends of justice. Therefore, the appellant is sentenced to the period already undergone. (iv) The bail bonds, if any, shall stand discharged. Result of the case: Appeal Partly allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
