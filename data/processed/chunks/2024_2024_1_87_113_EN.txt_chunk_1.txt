[Paras 25, 28, 29, 31, 41] Evidence Act, 1872 – ss.25-27 – s.27, an exception to ss.25, 26 – Doctrine of confirmation by subsequent events: Held: s.27 is an exception to ss.25 and 26 – s.27 makes that part of the statement which distinctly leads to discovery of a fact in consequence of the information received from a person accused of an offence, to the extent it distinctly relates to the fact thereby discovered, admissible in evidence against the accused – The fact which is discovered as a consequence of the information given is admissible in evidence – Further, the fact discovered must lead to recovery of a physical object and only that information which distinctly relates to that discovery can be proved – s.27 is based on the doctrine of confirmation by subsequent events- a fact is actually discovered in consequence of the information given, which results in recovery of a physical object – The facts discovered and the recovery is an assurance that the information given by a person [2024] 1 S.C.R. 89 PERUMAL RAJA @ PERUMAL v. STATE, REP. BY INSPECTOR OF POLICE accused of the offence can be relied – However, s.27 does not lay down the principle that discovery of a fact is to be equated to the object produced or found. [Paras 19, 22] Evidence Act, 1872 – s.27 – Conditions necessary for bringing s.27 into operation, discussed – Facts proved by the prosecution – Duty of the Court – Evidence produced in terms of s.27 – Evidentiary value: Held: The facts proved by the prosecution, particularly the admissible portion of the statement of the accused, would give rise to two alternative hypotheses, (i) that the accused had himself deposited the physical items which were recovered; or (ii) only the accused knew that the physical items were lying at that place – The second hypothesis is wholly compatible with the innocence of the accused, whereas the first would be a factor to show involvement of the accused in the offence – The court has to analyse which of the hypotheses should be accepted in a particular case – s.27 is frequently used by the police, and the courts must be vigilant about its application to ensure credibility of evidence, as the provision is vulnerable to abuse – However, this does not mean that in every case invocation of s.27 must be seen with suspicion and is to be discarded as perfunctory and unworthy of credence – Evidentiary value to be attached on evidence produced before the court in terms of s.27 cannot be codified or put in a straightjacket formula – It depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case – A holistic and inferential appreciation of evidence is required to be adopted in a case of circumstantial evidence. [Paras 23, 24] Evidence Act, 1872– ss.24-27 – “accused person”, “a person accused of any offence”: Held: The bar u/s.25 applies equally whether or not the person against whom evidence is sought to be led in a criminal trial was in custody at the time of making the confession – For the ban to be effective the person need not have been accused of an offence when he made the confession – The reason is that the expression “accused person” in s.24 and the expression “a person accused of any offence” in ss.26 and 27 have the same connotation, and describe the person against whom evidence is sought to be led in a criminal proceeding – The adjectival clause “accused of any offence” is, therefore, descriptive of the person against whom a 90 [2024] 1 S.C.R.
