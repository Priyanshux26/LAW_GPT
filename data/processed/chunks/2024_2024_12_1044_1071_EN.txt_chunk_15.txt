There is no evidence or circumstance to show that there were any mala fides on the part of these officers.” 35. The learned Special Judge, without even giving notice to her, only on the basis of the arguments advanced at the stage of final hearing of the matter, made adverse observations against her by almost finding her guilty of the offence punishable under Section 58 of the NDPS Act. Moreover while doing so, neither any notice nor was any opportunity of being heard given to her. After the said and of conviction/acquittal was recorded by the learned Special Judge on 22nd/24th February 2007, within 2 days, a notice under Section 58 of the NDPS Act was issued to the appellant on 26th February 2007. The appellant, in response to the said notice, appeared before the learned Special Judge on 15th March 2007 and on 12th April 2007, she also filed a reply. In the meantime, the appellant approached the High Court challenging the said show-cause notice dated 26th February 2007. The High Court, vide dated 19th May 2008, refused to entertain the revision with the observation that the passed by the learned Special Judge should not be construed as an expression of opinion on the merits of the matter. Immediately [2024] 12 S.C.R. 1067 Bharti Arora v. The State of Haryana on the very next day of the passing of the said of the High Court, the learned Special Judge proceeded to hear the matter at a lightning speed. Within 10 days, from 20th May 2008 to 30th May 2008, the learned Special Judge directed the matter to be heard on 7 dates. Though the transfer was issued on 26th May 2008 and the learned Special Judge was directed to immediately relinquish the post/charge, the learned Special Judge again kept the matter on 27th May 2008, 28th May 2008, 29th May 2008 and finally on 30th May 2008. During the said period, the appellant was directed to supervise and ensure the maintenance of law and inasmuch as the situation had deteriorated on account of some agitation. The same was also brought to the notice of the learned Special Judge. However, on 30th May 2008, the learned Special Judge proceeded to dictate and type the and kept the same in a sealed cover. It is thus clear that the learned Special Judge had given a complete go-bye to all the principles of natural justice. 36. It is a well-settled principle of law that justice should not only be done but should be seen to be done. In this respect, it will be relevant to refer to the following passage from Jackson’s Natural Justice (1980 Edn. ): “The distinction between justice being done and being seen to be done has been emphasised in many cases. . . . The requirement that justice should be seen to be done may be regarded as a general principle which in some cases can be satisfied only by the observance of the rules of natural justice or as itself forming one of those rules.
