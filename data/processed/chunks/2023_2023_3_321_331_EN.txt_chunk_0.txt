A be noted that as such the Special Judge granted seven days police custody of the respondent-accused on 16.04.2021. The granting seven days police custody as such had attained finality. However, it so happened that before the seven days police custody is over and before the CBI exercises the power of interrogation for full seven days which as per the passed by the learned B Special Judge was available to the CBI, the respondent-accused got himself hospitalised on 18.04.2021. On 21.04.2021, the learned Special Judge granted interim bail to the accused. As per the settled position of law therefore once on bail/interim bail, during that period there cannot be any police custody. Therefore, C the CBI could not interrogate the respondent-accused for full seven days under the police custody remand, which otherwise the CBI was entitled to. That thereafter, the accused remained in the hospital from time to time during the interim bail which also came to be extended from time to time.
