25. It is also projected that many more vacancies of primary teachers have since become available. As the recruitment process was initiated on 12.9.2006, vacancies are bound to occur by efflux of time but to appointment against the later vacancies (beyond the 1423 posts notified on 12.9.2006) will mean, infringing the rights of those who have since become eligible to apply for consideration, for the subsequent vacancies. Therefore, the beneficiaries of this subject to their respective merit position in the revised select list, should in our opinion be accommodated only against the notified 1423 posts. The appointment to the 214 OBC category candidates was set aside by the High Court on 6.10.2015 and the said decision was left undisturbed by the Supreme Court in its dated 16.03.2016 and as such these vacancies will be available to accommodate most of the deserving selectees. 26. Mr. V. Giri, the learned Senior Counsel representing the State of Manipur in the above context informs the Court that the Primary Teachers who were appointed on 09.12.2011 are serving for over 13 years and some of them might have to make way for the selectees. Mr. Anupam Lal Das, the learned senior counsel in his turn submits that the clients he represents were appointed on substantive basis by the Government on 9.12.2011. Despite their long service, a few of them may not find place in the revised select list for adjustment against the 1423 notified vacancies. The submission is that since the cases before the High Court and this Court had continued for over a decade in one form or the other, the appointment of the long serving teachers should be protected. 27. On the above contention of Mr. Giri supported by Mr. Das, we need to observe that appointment is being ed for those whose names would figure in the revised select list, strictly in of merit against the 1423 vacancies notified on 12.9.2006. We do appreciate that the concerned appointees have been serving for over 13 years and disruption of their service may lead to unimaginable hardships for this group of people. It is therefore left to the Government’s discretion to 36 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports take a decision for those who are serving and whose names may not figure in the revised select list, in pursuant to the ed exercise. 28. In conclusion, the rendered by the High Court on 6.10.2015 in the W.P (C) No.8153 of 2011 and W.P(C) No.127 of 2012 are upheld. In consequence, the appeals/writ petitions filed by the aspirant teachers stand disposed of and those filed by the State of Manipur stand dismissed. The State authorities must draw up the revised select list in terms of the High Court’s within 4 weeks from today. The appointment s for those who figure in the revised select list are ed to be issued, within 4 weeks of the publication of the select list. By virtue of such appointments, the fresh appointees shall have no claim towards arrears salary.
