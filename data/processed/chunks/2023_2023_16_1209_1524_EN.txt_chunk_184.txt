60. The of the learned Chief Justice, propounded a theory of a unifi ed thread of rights, entitlements fl owing from it, and how lack of recognition, results in deprivation of specifi ed rights under Articles 19 and 25 (in addition to Article 21). To the extent, that assertion of sexual 55 1964 (1) SCR 332 56 1986 (3) SCR 518 57 2004 (1) SCR 1038 146 2 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. or gender identity, in exercise of free speech, association, through express manifestations in whatever form (whether through speech, art, participation in processions, etc. ), are concerned, one cannot join issue. Equally, if one has by some state process, measure or conduct been barred from expressing one’s choice, publicly, the reasonableness of that prohibition or , can be tested on grounds enumerated in Article 19(2), if such barriers are through a valid law, or s, traceable to law. 61. However, when the law is silent, and leaves the parties to express choice, Article 19(1)(a) does not oblige the state to enact a law, or frame a regulation, which enables the facilitation of that expression. All s, from Sakal Papers58, to Bennet Coleman59 and Express Newspapers60, etc. were based on the eff ect of laws or policies, based on statutory provisions. Equally, in the absence of a legal framework enabling citizens to form a particular kind of association (as for instance recognition of a limited liability partnership, which was not recognized any legal status till recently)61 the court could not have validly created a regime enabling recognition or regulating such associations. Similarly, in the absence of any enacted law which obliges meaningful facilitation of transport such as roads, it is hard to visualize that a citizen can approach the Court and seek the construction of a road to enforce the right to travel [Article 19(1)(d)], or seek court’s intervention to create a network of roads or other modes of transportation. Likewise in the absence of a basic housing scheme again the court if approached for enforcement of Article 19(1)(e), would not call upon the State to create one either by framing a general legislative policy or through law. Furthermore, this Court has also recognized that, there can even be reasonable restrictions, in the acquisition and enjoyment of certain types of properties in many States. Given the nature of rights under Articles 19 and 21 the enjoyment of which are limited to the extent reasonable laws within the bounds of the specifi ed provisions, enact in the legitimate jurisdiction of this court, it would be diffi cult to translate the positive obligations (or postulates) as articulated in the learned chief justice’s opinion. 58 Sakal Papers (P) Ltd v.
