]” 14 Section 48 reads: “48. Conditions for enforcement of foreign awards.—(1) Enforcement of a foreign award may be refused, at the request of the party against whom it is invoked, only if that party furnishes to the court proof that— (a) the parties to the agreement referred to in section 44 were, under the law applicable to them, under some incapacity, or the said agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of the country where the award was made; or (b) the party against whom the award is invoked was not given proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or (c) the award deals with a difference not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration: Provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, that part of the award which contains decisions on matters submitted to arbitration may be enforced; or (d) the composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with the law of the country where the arbitration took place; or (e) the award has not yet become binding on the parties, or has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority of the country in which, or under the law of which, that award was made. (2) Enforcement of an arbitral award may also be refused if the Court finds that— (a) the subject-matter of the difference is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law of India; or (b) the enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of India. [Explanation 1.—For the avoidance of any doubt, it is clarified that an award is in conflict with the public policy of India, only if,— (i) the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in violation of section 75 or section 81; or 302 [2024] 8 S.C.R.

Section 50 provides for appeal against certain s, i.e., s refusing to refer parties to arbitration under Section 45 and s refusing to enforce a foreign award under Section 48.15 Finally, Section 5116 is a savings clause and Section 5217 provides that Chapter II of Part II shall not apply to awards governed under this Chapter. 4.1 From the statutory scheme, it is clear that a foreign arbitral award is binding between the parties when it is enforceable under Part II, Chapter I of the Act (Section 46). The enforceability of the award can be challenged under Section 48, and the passed on such an application can be appealed under Section 50 only if it is allowed and the court refuses enforcement of the award.
