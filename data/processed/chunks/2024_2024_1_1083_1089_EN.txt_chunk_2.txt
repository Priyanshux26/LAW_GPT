5. The dated 13th June, 2019 passed by learned trial Court was not challenged any further and thus the same attained finality. The trial Court, proceeded to convict the accused appellant vide dated 7th November, 2019. 6. The appellant preferred an appeal before the Principal Sessions Judge, Gandhinagar and during pendency thereof, he filed an application under Section 391 CrPC for taking additional evidence at appellate stage and seeking a direction to obtain the opinion of the handwriting expert after comparing the admitted signature of the accused appellant and the signature as appearing on the disputed cheque. Another prayer made in the said application was that the concerned officer from the Post Office should be summoned so as to prove the defence theory that the notice under Section 138 of NI Act was never received by the accused appellant. 7. Such application preferred by the appellant was rejected by the learned Principal Sessions Judge, Gandhinagar vide detailed dated 25th July, 2023, which was carried by the appellant to the High Court by filing the captioned Criminal Misc. Application No. 17933/2023 which came to be dismissed by dated 25th October, 2023 which is under challenge in this appeal. 8. We have considered the submissions advanced by learned counsel for the appellant and have gone through the impugned and the material placed on record. 9. At the outset, we may note that the law is well-settled by a catena of s rendered by this Court that power to record additional evidence under Section 391 CrPC should only be exercised when the party making such request was prevented from presenting the evidence in the trial despite due diligence being exercised or that the facts giving rise to such prayer came to light at a later stage during pendency of the appeal and that non-recording of such evidence may lead to failure of justice. [2024] 1 S.C.R. 1087 Ajitsinh Chehuji Rathod v. State of Gujarat & Anr. 10. It is apposite to mention that the learned first appellate Court, i.e., the Principal Sessions Judge, Gandhinagar had taken note of the fact that during the trial, the appellant examined the witness of the Bank of Baroda in support of his defence but not a single question was put to the said witness regarding genuineness or otherwise of the signatures as appearing on the cheque in question. 11. Furthermore, as per the cheque return memo of the Bank dated 26th February, 2018, the reason for the cheque being returned unpaid is clearly recorded as “funds insufficient and account dormant”. 12. There is a specific column no. 10 in the said written memo which reads as follows:- “Bank of Baroda (HEAD OFFICE MANDVI, BARODA) Infocity Branch Date: 26.02.2018 Cheque No. 503273 for Rs. 10,00,000/- returned unpaid for reason No. 22 3093010008596 1-9 …. 10 Drawer’s signature differs from specimen recorded with us. 11-22 ….” Manifestly, the cheque was not returned unpaid for the reason that the signature thereupon differed from the specimen signature recorded with the bank.
