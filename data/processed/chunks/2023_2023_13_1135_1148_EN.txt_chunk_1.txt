[Para 14] Constitution of India – Art. 16 – Right to claim public employment by the candidate: Held: Candidate has no legal right to claim public employment – Candidate has only a right to be considered therefor – Once a candidate is declared ineligible to participate in the selection process at the threshold and if he still wishes to participate in the process perceiving that his candidature has been arbitrarily rejected, it is for him to work out his remedy – However, if the candidature is not rejected at the threshold and the candidate is allowed to participate in the selection process and ultimately his name fi gures in the merit list, though such candidate has no indefeasible right to claim appointment, he does have a limited right of being accorded fair and non-discriminatory treatment – He has a reasonable expectation of being appointed having regard to his position in the merit list could arise – Employer-State would have no authority to act in an arbitrary manner and throw the candidate out without rhyme or reason – Law places an obligation, nay duty, on such an employer to provide some justifi cation by way of reason – If plausible justifi cation is provided, the courts would be loath to question the justifi cation but the justifi cation must be rational and UNION OF INDIA v. UZAIR IMRAN & ORS. 1137 justifi able, and not whimsical or capricious, warranting non-interference – Arts. 12, 14. [Para 15] LIST OF CITATIONS AND OTHER REFERENCES Malik Mazhar Sultan v. U.P.
