In Delhi Judicial Service Association (supra), this Court observes that any prohibition or restriction contained in ordinary laws cannot act as a limitation on the constitutional F power of this Court to issue any or direction to do ‘complete justice’ in any ‘cause’ or ‘matter’. Finally, the moderated approach has its origin in Union Carbide Corporation (supra), which holds that this Court, in exercising powers under Article 142 and in assessing the needs of ‘complete justice’ of a ‘cause’ or ‘matter’, will take note of the express prohibitions in any substantive statutory provision based on some fundamental principles of public policy and regulate the exercise of its power and discretion accordingly. The of Supreme Court Bar Association (supra), applies G cautious and balanced approach, to hold that Article 142 being curative in nature and a constitutional power cannot be controlled by any statutory provision, but this power is not meant to be exercised ignoring the statutory provisions or directly in conflict with what is expressly provided in the statute. At the same-time, it observes, that this Court will not ordinarily discard a statutory provision governing the subject, except perhaps to balance the equities between the conflicting claims of the parties to “iron out the creases” in a ‘cause or matter’ before it. [See - Rajat Pradhan, Ironing out the H 190 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A satisfied that the departure from the said procedure is necessary to do ‘complete justice’ between the parties.28 Difference between procedural and substantive law in jurisprudential terms is contentious, albeit not necessary to be examined in depth in the present decision29, as in terms of the dictum enunciated by this Court in Union Carbide Corporation (supra) and Supreme Court Bar Association (supra), exercise of power B under Article 142(1) of the Constitution of India to do ‘complete justice’ in a ‘cause or matter’ is prohibited only when the exercise is to pass an which is plainly and expressly barred by statutory provisions of substantive law based on fundamental considerations of general or specific public policy. As explained in Supreme Court Bar Association C (supra),the exercise of power under Article 142(1) of the Constitution of India being curative in nature, this Court would not ordinarily pass an ignoring or disregarding a statutory provision governing the subject, except to balance the equities between conflicting claims of the litigating parties by ironing out creases in a ‘cause or matter’ before it. In this sense, this Court is not a forum of restricted jurisdiction when it decides D and settles the dispute in a ‘cause or matter’. While this Court cannot supplant the substantive law by building a new edifice where none existed earlier, or by ignoring express substantive statutory law provisions, it is a problem-solver in the nebulous areas. As long as ‘complete justice’ required by the ‘cause or matter’ is achieved without violating fundamental E principles of general or specific public policy, the exercise of the power and discretion under Article 142(1) is valid and as per the Constitution of India.
