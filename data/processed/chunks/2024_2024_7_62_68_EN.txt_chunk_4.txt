In absence of the sanction the entire procedure remains flawed. We are completely in agreement by the decision of the High Court and therefore are not inclined to interfere with the impugned passed by the High Court and accordingly this appeal is hereby dismissed. Pending application(s), if any, shall also stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Nidhi Jain
