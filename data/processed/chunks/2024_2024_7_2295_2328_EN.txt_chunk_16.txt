vs. Ganga Bai Menariya (dead) through Lrs. and others.24 25. Both the learned senior counsel for the respondents thus submitted that the appeal was devoid of merit and liable to be dismissed. 26. From the submissions advanced and the perusal of the material on record, the following issues/questions arise for consideration in the present appeal: 1) Whether the sale deed dated 02.12.1985 was executed by Respondent No. 2? 2) Whether the sale consideration was paid with respect to sale deed dated 02.12.1985? 3) Whether the sale deed dated 02.12.1985 was presented for registration on 05.12.1985 or not? 4) Whether delayed registration of the sale deed dated 02.12.1985 would prove to be fatal? 21 [2007] 2 SCR 141 : (2007) 2 SCC 404 22 [2019] 4 SCR 1069 : (2020) 16 SCC 601 23 (2015) 5 SCC 622 24 [2024] 2 SCR 650 : (2024) 2 SCR 650 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2319 Kaushik Premkumar Mishra & Anr. v. Kanji Ravaria @ Kanji & Anr. 5) Whether non-mutation would take away the right created by the sale deed in favor of the vendees? 6) Whether respondent no.2 had any right, title or interest left in the suit property after 02.12.1985? 7) Whether the sale deed dated 02.12.1985 was void as the vendees were alleged to be minors? 8) Whether the respondent no. 1 was a bona fide purchaser for value by way of a subsequent sale deed dated 03.12.2010? 27. Having considered the submissions advanced by the counsels for the parties our analysis on the issues stated above is as under. As the issues/questions raised are interlinked, they have been taken up together in our analysis. 28. At the outset, it may be relevant to refer to the certified/xerox copy of the sale deed dated 2.12.1985, presented for registration on 5.12.1985, copies of which were filed by both the sides under the direction of this Court. We have carefully perused the sale deed. The following facts may be noticeable from the said perusal: (i). The stamp paper had been purchased on 29.11.1985. (ii). The document was prepared and executed on 02.12.1985 (iii). The document was presented before the Sub-Registrar on 5.12.1985. The total value of the stamp paper used was Rs 1,600/-. (iv). The document was presented by respondent no.2, the vendor. (v). The document bears the signature of Anees Ismail Khoja, respondent no. 2, the witnesses and also contains the respective endorsement by the Sub-Registrar. (vi). The document was impounded for non-payment of proper stamp duty. However, on 14.6.2011 the deficiency in stamp duty of Rs.2200/- along with penalty of Rs.500/- and other statutory payments of Rs.700/- having been paid, it was finally registered in Book No. 1 from pages 141-147. (vii). The document bears the signatures of not only the vendor, the attesting witnesses and also the necessary endorsement by the Sub-Registrar. This makes it abundantly clear that the 2320 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports sale deed was executed on 02.12.1985 and presented before the Sub-Registrar on 5.12.1985.
