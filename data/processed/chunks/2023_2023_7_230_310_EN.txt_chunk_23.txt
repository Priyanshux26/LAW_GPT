8597-8599 of 2010. H 264 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 7 S.C.R. A came under scrutiny after the change of government in the 2018 Rajasthan elections. The newly elected Council of Ministers constituted a Cabinet Committee on 01.01.2019 to review decisions made by the prior ruling government in the 6 months period preceding the elections. While this internal consideration was unfolding, RIICO directed its unit offices to cease grant of permissions for conversion of use of land under B Rule 20(c) of the 1979 Rules on 27.05.2019, until further notice. The Kota branch of RIICO, however, proceeded to allow sub-division of the LIA, Kota, as requested by Respondent No. 1, on 05.07.2019. The mistake became clear only after the sub-division was sanctioned, necessitating the issuance of withdrawal s by the office at Kota in C respect of both the conversion of land and the sub-division of the plot, on 22.07.2019 and 25.07.2019, respectively. 27. Meanwhile, the internal deliberations by the Cabinet Committee set up by the State Government extended till 03.08.2019, when the Committee resolved to cancel all the permissions and approvals granted to Respondent No. 1 in respect of conversion of the property at LIA, D Kota. 28. The State Government directed RIICO, by exercising the powers it believed were vested in it under Article 138 of RIICO’s Articles of Association, to carry out the requisite steps to annul the approvals provided to Respondent No. 1. RIICO issued s on 11.10.2019 and E 14.10.2019, to finally cancel the permission for conversion of land, as well as cancel the supplementary leases themselves that had been subsisting in the name of Respondent No. 1. 29. Respondent No. 1 was aggrieved by these actions and made various representations to the State Government, as well as RIICO, F seeking to have its lease and possession over the land restored. Eventually, it filed a Writ Petition before the High Court challenging the cancellation of its lease and the permission for conversion of the use of the land. The arguments raised included: (a) Article 138 of the AoA of RIICO did not have statutory force G and a third party could not be adversely impacted by decisions made or directions issued under it; (b) Even if Article 138 had statutory force, the manner in which the approvals and permissions accorded to Respondent No. 1 were quashed and set aside, was arbitrary, unreasoned, and H unconstitutional due to falling afoul of Article 14 of the Constitution; BISHAMBHAR PRASAD v. M/s. ARFAT PETROCHEMICALS 265 PVT. LTD. AND ORS. [SURYA KANT, J.] (c) Respondent No. 1 had not even been issued a show cause A notice nor given a chance to defend itself. Thus, the Principles of Natural Justice had not been followed in the process of cancelling the allotment; (d) The procedure under the 1979 Rules had to be followed, as the LIA, Kota had been transferred to RIICO under the 18.09.1979 B . 30. The State Government and its authorities objected to the maintainability of the petition on the ground that Article 138 of the AoA of RIICO were not statutory in nature and, hence, a Writ could not be filed in this regard.
