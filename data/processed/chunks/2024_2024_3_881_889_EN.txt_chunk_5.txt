Section 6 of the 2023 Act postulates five prospective candidates which, prima facie, appears to mean that for two vacant posts ten prospective candidates should have been shortlisted. Procedural sanctity of the selection process requires fair deliberation with examination of background and merits of the candidate. The sanctity of the process should not be affected. Nevertheless, in spite of the said shortcoming, we do not deem it appropriate at this stage, keeping in view the timelines for the upcoming 18th General Elections for the Lok Sabha, to pass any interim or direction. As indicated above, this would lead to chaos and virtual constitutional breakdown. Remand at this stage would not resolve the matter. It may also be relevant to state that the petitioners have not commented or questioned the merits of the persons selected/appointed as Ecs. 15. Further, EC being a constitutional post, it is wise to remind ourselves that once a constitutional post holder is selected, they are duty bound to act in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Constitution. The assumption is that they shall adhere to constitutional role and propriety in their functioning. To borrow from Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, Chairman, Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly of India: “However good a Constitution may be, if those who are implementing it are not good, it will prove to be bad. However bad a Constitution may be, if those implementing it are good, it will prove to be good.” 16. Having regard to the aforesaid position, we are not inclined to accept the prayer for grant of stay. Accordingly, the applications seeking stay 18 [1995] Suppl. 2 SCR 106 : (1995) 4 SCC 611. [2024] 3 S.C.R. 889 Dr. Jaya Thakur & Ors. v. Union of India & Anr. are dismissed. We would clarify that the observations in this are tentative and are not to be treated as final and binding, as the matter is sub-judice. 17.
