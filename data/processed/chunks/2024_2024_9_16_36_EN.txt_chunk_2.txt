[2024] 9 S.C.R. 19 Vaibhav Jain v. Hindustan Motors Pvt. Ltd. Case Arising From CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 10192 of 2024 From the and dated 15.11.2017 of the High Court of Chhattisgarh at Bilaspur in MA No. 1306 of 2007 Appearances for Parties Arup Banerjee, Amit Poddar, Priyanshu Raj, R. K. Dey, Rajiv Agnihotri, Sanjeev Sharma, Advs. for the Appellant. Ms. Purti Gupta, Ms. Henna George, Advs. for the Respondent. / of the Supreme Court Manoj Misra, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. This appeal impugns the and of the High Court of Chhattisgarh at Bilaspur1 dated 15.11.2017, whereby Miscellaneous Appeal (Civil) No. 1306 of 2007 filed by the appellant was dismissed and Miscellaneous Appeal (Civil) No. 1147/2017 filed by the claimant(s) was allowed thereby enhancing the compensation already awarded to them. 3. At the outset, we would like to put on record that the Special Leave Petition (SLP) against the impugned was filed by impleading six respondents. Respondents 1 to 4 (R-1 to R-4) were heirs and legal representatives of the deceased Pranay Kumar Goswami on whose accidental death the claim arose. Respondent no. 5 (R-5), namely, Shubhashish Pal, was the person who drove the vehicle at the time of accident; and Respondent no.6 (R-6), namely, M/s Hindustan Motors, was the manufacturer of the vehicle. However, on 23.10.2018, this Court issued notice only to the manufacturer (R- 6) (i.e., M/s Hindustan Motors) and the SLP was dismissed qua R-1 to R-5 by observing that the question raised in the matter is about the liability of the dealer (i.e., the appellant). Therefore, in our view, the impugned award has attained finality insofar as the rights of the 1 High Court 20 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports claimant-respondents are concerned.

Be that as it may to have a clear understanding of the matter, we shall describe the parties as they were described in the SLP at the time of its presentation. FACTUAL MATRIX 4. A claim petition for death compensation was filed before the Tribunal by claimant-respondents (R-1 to R-4) (i.e., legal heirs of the deceased who died in the accident), under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988,2 against driver of the offending vehicle (R- 5); M/s. Hindustan Motors Private Limited (R-6) (i.e., manufacturer of the vehicle); and Vaibhav Jain (i.e., Proprietor of M/s Vaibhav Motors - the dealer of R-6) (the appellant herein). The deceased was R-6’s Territory Manager whereas the driver of the vehicle was R-6’s Service Engineer. Thus, the driver and the deceased were employees of R-6 (i.e., M/s Hindustan Motors). The accident took place when the vehicle was taken out for a test drive from the dealership of the appellant. 5. On the pleadings of the parties, five issues were framed by the Tribunal. Out of those five, the issue relevant for the purposes of this appeal is: Whether prior to the accident M/s.
