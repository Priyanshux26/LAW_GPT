Two of the issues involved in the present appeals with regard to SHR and GCV also fell for consideration before the CERC. 36. The CERC found that the CERC norms applicable for the period 2009-14 and 2014-19 do not provide the norms for 300 MW units. It further found that the CERC norms provide for a degradation factor of 6.5% and 4.5% respectively towards Heat Rate over and above the H MAHARASHTRA STATE ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION CO. LTD. v. 97 ADANI POWER MAHARASHTRA LTD. [B. R. GAVAI, J.] Design Heat Rate. It found that since the Design Heat Rate is 2211 A kcal/kWh, the gross Heat Rate works out to 2355 kcal/kWh and 2310 kcal/kWh for the period 2009-14 and 2014-19 respectively. It directed that the SHR of 2355 kcal/kWh during the period 2009-14 and 2310 kcal/kWh during the period 2014-19 or the actual SHR, whichever was lower, shall be considered for calculating the coal consumption for B compensation under the Change in Law.
