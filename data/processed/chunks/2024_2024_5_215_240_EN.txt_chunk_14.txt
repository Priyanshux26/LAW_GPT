Thanking you, .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .” (emphasis added) As seen from clause (4), the agreement was only for twelve months ending on 31st March 2015. Therefore, on 1st April 2015, another letter was issued by the corporate debtor to the first respondent, incorporating identical terms and conditions. The only difference is 236 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports that the agreement’s duration was up to 31st March 2016. Clause (10) of the agreement/letter dated 1st April 2015 reads thus: “.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. #10 You have to deposit minimum security of Rs.53,15,000/- with the Company which will carry interest @21% per annum. We will provide you interest on Rs.32,85,850/- @21% per annum. Please acknowledge receipt and as a token of your acceptance of above terms and conditions. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .” 14. Where one party owes a debt to another and when the creditor is claiming under a written agreement/arrangement providing for rendering ‘service’, the debt is an operational debt only if the claim subject matter of the debt has some connection or co-relation with the ‘service’ subject matter of the transaction. The written document cannot be taken for its face value. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the real nature of the transaction on a plain reading of the agreements. What is surprising is that for acting as a Sales Promoter of the beer manufactured by a corporate debtor, only a sum of Rs.4,000/- per month was made payable to the first respondent. Apart from the sum of Rs.4,000/- per month, there is no commission payable to the first respondent on the quantity of sales. Clause (6) provides for termination of the appointment by giving thirty days’ notice. Though clause (10) provides for the payment of the security deposit by the first respondent, it is pertinent to note that there is no clause for the forfeiture of the security deposit. The amount specified in clause (10) has no correlation whatsoever with the performance of the other conditions of the contract by the first respondent. As there is no clause regarding forfeiture of the security deposit or part thereof, the corporate debtor was liable to refund the security deposit after the period specified therein was over with interest @21% per annum. Since the security deposit payment had no correlation with any other clause under the agreements, as held by the NCLAT, the security deposit amounts represent debts covered by sub-section (11) of Section 3 of the IBC. The reason is that the right of the first respondent to seek a refund of the security deposit with interest is a claim within the meaning of sub-section (6) of Section 3 of the IBC [2024] 5 S.C.R. 237 Global Credit Capital Limited & Anr.
