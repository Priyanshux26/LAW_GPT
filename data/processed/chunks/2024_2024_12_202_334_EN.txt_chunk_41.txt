77. This Court, after referring to Section 28 of the Act, 1962 as it stood during the period in dispute, concluded that from a conjoint reading of Section 2(34) and Section 28 of the Act, 1962, it is manifest that only such a customs officer who has been assigned the specific functions of assessment and re-assessment of duty in the jurisdictional area where the import concerned has been effected, either by the Board or the Commissioner of Customs, in terms of Section 2(34) of the Act, 1962, was competent to issue notice under Section 28 of the Act, 1962. 78. This Court further held that “…any other reading of Section 28 would render the provisions of Section 2(34) of the Act otiose in as much as the test contemplated under Section 2(34) of the Act of the Act is that of specific conferment of such functions”. It further held that “Moreover, if the Revenue’s contention that once territorial jurisdiction is conferred, the Collector of Customs (Preventive) becomes a “proper officer” in terms of Section 28 of the Act, 1962 is accepted, it would lead to a situation of utter chaos and confusion, in as much as all officers of customs, in a particular area be it under the Collectorate of Customs (Imports) or the Preventive Collectorate, would be “proper officers” ”. 79. This Court concluded that “It is only the officers of customs, who are assigned the functions of assessment, which of course, would include re- assessment, working under the jurisdictional Collectorate within whose jurisdiction the bills of entry or baggage declarations had been filed and the consignments had been cleared for home consumption, will have the jurisdiction to issue notice under Section 28 of the Act”. Thus, the proceedings impugned therein were set aside. 80. Thereafter, a Review Petition was filed by the Department in the aforesaid case. This Court dismissed the Review Petition on the ground of delay in filing the review. [2024] 12 S.C.R. 267 Commissioner of Customs v. M/s Canon India Pvt. Ltd. 81. ⁠The decision in Sayed Ali (supra) proceeds on the assumption that for the “proper officer” to exercise the functions under Section 28 of the Act, 1962, such officer must necessarily possess the power of assessment and reassessment under Section 17. However, a plain reading of Sections 17 and 28 of the Act, 1962 does not bring out any such inter-dependence between the two provisions. Having looked into the statutory scheme of the Act, 1962, we are of the view that the observations pertaining to the interlinkage between Sections 17 and 28 respectively of the Act, 1962 made in Sayed Ali (supra) do not lay down the correct position of law. 82. Even otherwise, the decision in Sayed Ali (supra) could have been arrived at without deciding on the interdependence of Section 17 and Section 28 of the Act, 1962 as the Customs (Preventive) officers, whose jurisdiction to issue show cause notices was under challenge in that case, were not assigned the functions of the “proper officer” for the purposes of Section 28 through a notification issued by the appropriate authority.
