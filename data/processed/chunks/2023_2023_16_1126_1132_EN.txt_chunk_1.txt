This appeal is directed against the dated 23.10.2019 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in Criminal Misc. Application No. 471 of 2018. 2. FIR No. 839 of 2016 was registered at Sector 49 Noida, Police Station against the appellant, his parents and relatives on 4.9.2016 alleging commission of off ences under Sections 323, 363, 384, and 406 of the Indian Penal Code. The charge sheet was subsequently fi led on 22.8.2017 in respect of commission of off ences under Sections 323, 384 and 406 I.P.C. Thereafter the accused, including the appellant herein, fi led an application under Section 482 CrPC seeking quashment of the FIR and the consequently fi led chargesheet and the summoning dated 19.09.2017 issued thereafter. As per the impugned , the High Court declined to exercise the power under Section 482 CrPC and consequently dismissed the petition qua the appellant. 3. Heard learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant and the learned panel counsel for the State of Uttar Pradesh. Though notice was issued and served on the second respondent, she has chosen not to appear and contest the matter. 4. As noticed hereinbefore, after the investigation, chargesheet was fi led in respect of off ences under Sections 323, 384 and 406 of the I.P.C. The fi rst respondent has also fi led counter affi davit. We have carefully gone through the materials on record. Having gone through the chargesheet, and the other material on record, we could not fi nd necessary ingredients to attract the off ences under Sections 323, 384 and 406 of the I.P.C. qua the appellant. 5. As relates the allegation of commission of off ence under Section 323, IPC besides the bald statement ‘when I asked these people about my daughter, they beat up me’ no material whatsoever to support the allegation causation of hurt is available on record much less voluntary causation of ABHISHEK SAXENA v. THE STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH 1129 & ANR. hurt. So also, about the demand of a sum of Rs. 20 Lakhs from her father after about 15 days from 12.06.2016 from the house of second respondent’s father in Bareilly, the second respondent (the complainant) in her statement dated 25.09.2016 given to the Investigating Offi cer, submitted that she did not get registered an FIR or fi le any complaint in Bareilly. That apart, the unrefuted position of facts revealed from the materials on record is that the appellant herein has already fi led a petition for dissolution of his marriage with the second respondent-complainant and also Application No.13/2016 under Sections 7, 10 and 17 of the Guardians & Wards Act, 1890 (for short ‘G&W Act’) for declaring him as the guardian of the person of the minor daughter by name ‘Anwesha Saxena’, before the learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Gautam Budh Nagar in Uttar Pradesh, on 16.05.2016.
