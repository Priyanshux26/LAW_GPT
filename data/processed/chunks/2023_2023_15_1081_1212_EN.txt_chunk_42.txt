The position of law which was laid down in Prima Paint (supra) was reiterated by the Supreme Court of the United States in Buckeye Check Cashing Inc v. Cardegna100 and Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson.101 In Rent-A-Center (supra), it was held that application of the severability rule does not depend on the substance of the remainder of the contract. 97 [2007] UKHL 40 98 Gary Born (n 62) 382 99 388 US 395 (1967) 100 546 U.S. 440, 440 (2006) 101 2 561 U.S. 63 (2010) 114 2 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 15 S.C.R. f. Singapore 100. The doctrine of separability has been statutorily recognized under the domestic arbitration regime in Singapore through Section 21 of the Singaporean Arbitration Act, 2001.102 The provision is that “an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract.” The separability presumption has been further explained by the Singapore High Court in BNA v. BNB. The High Court observed that the “parties intend their arbitration agreement to remain eff ective if a provision of the substantive contract into which it is integrated could, in certain circumstances of fact or law, operate to render their arbitration agreement invalid.”103 Thus, the Singapore High Court held that the purpose of the separability presumption is to insulate an arbitration agreement from invalidity that may arise from a challenge to the substantive contract. g. International Conventions 101. The New York Convention does not expressly provide for the separability presumption. Article II of the Convention defi nes an arbitration agreement as including “an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement, signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams.” Moreover, Article V(1)(a) provides that the recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award may be refused where the arbitration agreement “is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of the country where the award was made.” The provision rests on the premise that international arbitration agreements could be subjected to diff erent national laws and legal rules than the underlying contract, and, therefore, an arbitration agreement is presumptively separate from the underlying contract. According to Gary Born, Article II and Article V(1)(a) of the New York Convention indicate that the Convention treats an arbitration agreement as being diff erent from the underlying contract.104 102 Arbitration Act 2001 (No. 37 of 2001) 103 [2019] SGHC 142 104 Gary Born (n 62) 378 IN RE: INTERPLAY BETWEEN ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS UNDER 1143 THE ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT 1996 AND THE INDIAN STAMP ACT 1899 [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI ] 102. Article 16 of the Model Law deals with the competence of an arbitral tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction. Article 16(1) provides: “The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement. For that purpose, an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract.
