I submit that there is no scope for justifi cation of the action of execution of sale deeds which I undertook under the pressure built up by the agreement-holders. I request Your Lordships to accept my apology if deem fi t and proper.". (Emphasis supplied) 23. The High Court ultimately held the appellants guilty of contempt for their deliberate and wilful disobedience of the undertaking and punished them accordingly. 24. In such circumstances referred to above, the appellants are herein before this Court with the present appeals. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS IN CIVIL APPEAL NO. 5041 OF 2022 25. Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, the learned Senior Counsel appeared for the appellants of Civil Appeal No. 5041 of 2022. Mr. Rohatgi submitted the following: (a) The appellant Nos. 1 and 2 respectively had no idea or proper knowledge as to what was transpiring in the proceedings before the Revenue Authorities or the High Court for the reason that the appellants had appointed Balwantbhai Somabhai Bhandari (appellant of the connected appeal) as their power of attorney holder. The power of attorney holder looked after the litigation relating to the subject land and the appellants were not involved in any manner in the day to day activities. The sale deeds were not signed by the appellants as they were executed by the power of attorney holder. (b) The High Court materially erred in holding that the appellants had admitted in their affi davits that they were fully conversant and aware of the undertaking given before the High Court. This is a glaring factual error in as much as the perusal of all the three affi davits dated 07.10.2018, 28.10.2018 and 24.12.2018 1084 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 11 S.C.R. respectively fi led by the appellants state to the contrary that they were not aware of the dated 14.10.2015. (c) The High Court should have accepted the unconditional and bona fi de apology made at the fi rst instance. The High Court went wrong in saying that the apology was tendered at a belated stage. (d) Section 12 of the Act 1971 stipulates the punishment for contempt of Court. The proviso to the said section states that ‘accused may be discharged or punishment awarded may be remitted on apology being made to the satisfaction of the court’. Furthermore, the Explanation to the said proviso states that “an apology shall not be rejected merely on the ground that it is qualifi ed or conditional if the accused makes it bona fi de.” (e) The High Court committed a serious error in not accepting the explanation off ered by the appellants that the sale deeds had already been completed prior to the dated 14.10.2015 and only formal registration of the sale deeds was left. (f) The High Court committed error in recording that the properties were sold even after the notice of contempt was issued to the appellants. 26. In support of aforesaid submissions, the learned Senior Counsel placed reliance on the following case law: (i) Rama Narang v. Ramesh Narang and Another, (2006) 11 SCC 114; (ii) Anil K. Surana and Another v. State Bank of Hyderabad, (2007) 10 SCC 257; (iii) Bharat Steel Tubes Limited v. IFCI Limited, (2010) 14 SCC 77; and (iv) Abhishek Kumar Singh v. G. Pattanaik and Others, (2021) 7 SCC 613.
