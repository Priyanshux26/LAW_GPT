Digital Supreme Court Reports in matters which deal with constitutional rights.96 The standard of review to be adopted by courts must thus depend on the nature of the right which is alleged to be infringed. 59. A classification is constitutionally permissible if the following two prong test is satisfied: First, there must be an intelligible differentia between those forming a group and those left out. Second, the differentia must have a reasonable nexus with the object sought to be achieved. The Court now, within the traditional two-prong test has advocated for a more substantial inquiry that subsumes the following prongs: a. Objective: The Courts test the (i) genuineness of the objective by making a distinction between the ostensible objective and the real objective.97 The ostensible purpose is the purpose which is claimed by the State and the real purpose is the purpose identified by Courts based on the surrounding circumstances;98 and (ii) unreasonableness of the objective by determining if it is discriminatory.99 b. Means: The Courts undertake the following analysis while identifying the means: (i) whether there is a yardstick (that is, the basis) to differentiate those included and others excluded from the group;100 (ii) whether the yardstick is in compliance with constitutional provisions and values;101 (iii) whether all those similarly situated based on the yardstick have been grouped together;102 and (iv) whether the yardstick has a rational nexus with the objective.103 96 Navtej Singh Johar (supra), See opinion of Justice Indu Malhotra [14.9] 97 Joseph Shine v.

Vithal Rao, 1973 1 SCC 500 “26. […] The object itself cannot be discriminatory, for otherwise, for instance, if the object is to discriminate against one section of the minority the discrimination cannot be justified on the ground that there is a reasonable classification because it has rational relation to the object sought to be achieved.” 100 Anwar Ali Sarkar (supra) (1952) 1 SCC 1, [Das J, 66]. 101 See State of Punjab v.

The scope of judicial review of under-inclusive provisions 60. To determine if Section 6A is violative of Article 14 on the ground of under-inclusiveness, the scope of judicial review on the ground of under-inclusion first needs to be set out. 61. A provision is under-inclusive if it fails to regulate all those who are part of the problem that the legislature seeks to address and is over-inclusive if it regulates somebody/something that is not a part of the problem.104 That is, under-inclusiveness and over-inclusiveness depends on whether those who are similarly situated have not been included or those who are not similarly situated have been included.
