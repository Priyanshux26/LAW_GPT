C It is apparent on the face of the record that the record could never be reconstructed in its entirety, especially the relevant ones by the concerned District Court. The Court, nonetheless, found sufficiency in the partly reconstructed record, which included only a few documents, such as the FIR and upheld the conviction on merits. D 11.The learned counsel for the Appellant states that the law is settled on the issue, and in the absence of such records, a conviction cannot be stated to be on firm grounds and is liable to be set aside. The learned counsel places reliance on Shyam Deo Pandey and Others v. State of Bihar2, State of U.P. v. Abhai Raj Singh and Another3. He further placed reliance on High Court decisions, namely Ramesh E Kaushik v. State of Delhi4of the Delhi High Court; Raghuvir Sahai and Others v. State of U.P.5, Avdesh Rai and Others v. State of U.P.6and Tej Pal Singh and Others v. State of U.P.7of the Allahabad High Court. Consideration by this Court F 12. A conviction of any nature permanently marks a person’s character. It would be, in the specific circumstances of this case, unjustified. This is not to say that five hundred rupees as far back as 1995 was a small or insignificant amount; however, when the possibility G 1 (2014) 3 SCC 485, Paragraphs 8 – 13. 2 (1971) 1 SCC 855 3 (2004) 4 SCC 6 4 2022 SCC Online Del 4185 5 Criminal Appeal No.786 of 1979 6 Criminal Appeal No.346 of 1984 7 2015 SCC Online All 6581 H 520 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 4 S.C.R. A of appeal is extinguished due to the absence of essential material, the perusal and consideration of which is required to take stock of the matter and then uphold or reverse, as the case may be, then the benefit of the doubt has to be extended to the accused when he is in no manner responsible for the same. B 13.We must consider whether the non-availability of trial court records before the High Court and upholding conviction, despite the absence thereof, infringes the right to life and liberty of the accused enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. 14.It is well settled that following “procedure established by law” C in a criminal prosecution is a sacrosanct requirement. 15. In M.H. Hoskot v. State of Maharashtra8 (three-Judge Bench), Krishna Iyer J. writing for the Court observed that: “11. In short, a first appeal from the Sessions Court to the High Court, as provided in the Criminal Procedure Code, manifests D this value upheld in Article 21.” 16.It was further observed that every step that makes the right of appeal fruitful is obligatory, and every action or inaction which stultifies it is unfair and, ergo, unconstitutional. 17. In Manu Sharma v. State (NCT of Delhi)9(two-Judge E Bench), this Court has also noted that the due process of law shall deem to include fairness in trial. The Court gives a right to the accused to receive all documents and statements and move applications for the production of records relating to the case.
