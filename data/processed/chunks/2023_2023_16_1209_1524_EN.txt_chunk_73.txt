109 (2018) 7 SCC 192 131 4 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 16 S.C.R. not require individuals to fi rst convince others of the legitimacy of the exercise of constitutional rights before they exercise them. VI. Divorce 120. Section 10 of the Indian Divorce Act 1869, which is applicable to Christians, previously permitted the husband to fi le a petition for divorce on the ground that his wife was guilty of adultery. However, the wife was permitted to fi le a petition for divorce on the ground that her husband was guilty of adultery only in conjunction with certain other grounds (such as conversion to another religion or bigamy). In Mary Sonia Zachariah v. Union of India,110 the Kerala High Court inter alia struck down a part of Section 10 and permitted Christian women to seek divorce on the ground of adultery alone. Parliament amended the Indian Divorce Act 1869 in 2001 by substituting Section 10 with a provision that made various grounds of divorce (including adultery) available to both the husband and the wife, equally.111 It also introduced Section 10A, which permitted Christian marriages to be dissolved by mutual consent, for the fi rst time. 121. In terms of Hindu customary law, certain communities permitted divorce whereas others did not. The HMA extended the right of divorce to all Hindus when it was enacted in 1955. In 1976, Section 13B was introduced in the HMA, permitting Hindus to dissolve their marriage by mutual consent, for the fi rst time. In Shilpa Sailesh v. Varun Sreenivasan,112 this Court held that it has the authority to grant divorce when there is a complete and irretrievable breakdown of marriage notwithstanding the opposition of one of the parties to the marriage to its dissolution. 122. Islamic customary law permitted divorce in certain situations and through certain modes. One of the modes was talaq-e-biddat or triple talaq by which the husband could instantly, irrevocably, and unilaterally divorce his wife. In Shayara Bano v. Union of India,113 this Court held that the 110 1995 SCC OnLine Ker 288 111 The wife was permitted an additional ground of divorce, viz “the husband has, since the solemnization of the marriage, been guilty of rape, sodomy or bestiality.” See Section 10(2), Indian Divorce Act 1869. 112 2023 SCC OnLine SC 544 113 (2017) 9 SCC 1 SUPRIYO @ SUPRIYA CHAKRABORTY & ANR. v. UNION 1315 OF INDIA [DR. DHANANJAYA Y CHANDRACHUD, CJI] practice of severing the marital bond through the mode of talaq-e-biddat was unconstitutional. VII. The implications of the discussion in this segment 123. Mahatma Jyotirao Phule, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Pandita Ramabai, Tarabai Shinde, Raja Ram Mohun Roy and countless others voiced their opposition (to varying degrees and to varying eff ects) to one or the other practice discussed in this segment. Their views were met with fi erce opposition on the ground that the religious and cultural values of the subcontinent did not permit a departure from tradition. In some cases, the opposing groups relied on scriptures to justify their respective stances.114 When Dr. B R Ambedkar introduced the Hindu Code Bill, many opposed the provision for divorce on the ground that the Hindu religion did not envisage divorce because it was a sacrament.115 It is seen that there are competing understandings of the institution of marriage at every stage of its evolution.
