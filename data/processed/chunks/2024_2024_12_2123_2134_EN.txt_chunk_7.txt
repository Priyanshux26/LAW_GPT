In view of the above, there was no justification for the High Court in allowing the application under 7 Rule 11, on issues that were not evident from the plaint averments itself. The High Court was also not justified in holding that the limitation period commences from the date of registration itself. In this view of the matter the of the High Court is unsustainable. 14. In any event of the matter, the High Court was examining the issue while exercising jurisdiction under Section 100 of CPC and as such reversal of the of the first Appellate Court on facts was impermissible. 15. In view of the above, we allow the appeal and set aside the and dated 26.06.2024 passed by the High Court in Second Appeal No.53 of 2024 and we restore the dated 17.10.2023 of the First Appellate Court in Regular Civil Appeal No.6 of 2022. 2134 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 16. Since the original suit is of the year 2017, we direct that the trial Court should take up the suit and dispose it of as expeditiously as possible. We also make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion on the merits of the matter and our opinion is confined to determining the question as to whether the plaint should be rejected under 7 Rule 11, CPC. 17. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. Result of the case: Appeal allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Aandrita Deb, Hony. Associate Editor (Verified by: Shibani Ghosh, Adv.)
