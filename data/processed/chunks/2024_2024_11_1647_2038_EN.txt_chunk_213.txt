The said was impugned before the Division Bench of the Hon’ble High Court by way of Special Appeal 1321 of 2005 and connected matters, which was finally decided by the dated 05.01.2006, vide which the High Court dismissed the appeals filed by the appellants therein. The appeals/special leave petitions from the said are under challenge before this Court. 102. On 12.02.2019, a three Judge Bench has referred the present batch of appeals and petitions to a bench of seven Hon’ble Judges. Considering the intense divergence of opinion on the reference and the resultant scope of the present proceedings, the said deserves to be quoted in extenso as under : “3. The issue arising in S. Azeez Basha (supra) was referred to a Seven (07) Judges Bench by an of this Court dated 26th November, 1981 passed in Writ Petition (Civil) Nos. 54-57 of 1981 [Anjuman-e-Rahmania & Ors. vs. Distt. Inspector of School & Ors.]. 4. The aforesaid writ petitions i.e. Writ Petition (Civil) Nos. 54-57 of 1981 were heard along with other connected cases {lead being Writ Petition (Civil) No.317 of 1993 (T.M.A. Pai Foundation and others vs. State of Karnataka and others)] by a bench of Eleven (11) judges, the in which cases is reported in (2002) 8 SCC 481. 5. The question 3(a) which was formulated for an answer in T.M.A. Pai Foundation (supra) which coincidentally reflects the questions referred by the of this Court dated 26th November, 1981 passed in Writ Petition (Civil) Nos. 54-57 of 1981, is as follows: “3(a) What are the indicia for treating an educational institution as a minority educational institution? Would 1950 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports an institution be regarded as a minority educational institution because it was established by a person(s) belonging to a religious or linguistic minority or its being administered by a person(s) belonging to a religious or linguistic minority? 6. However, the Bench did not answer the question stating that it will be dealt with by the Regular Bench. 7. The of the Regular Bench passed on 11th March, 2003, which, for reasons that we need not dilate, did not answer the aforesaid question 3(a) formulated in T.M.A. Pai Foundation (supra). 8. The said facts would show that the correctness of the question arising from the decision of this Court in S. Azeez Basha (supra) has remained undetermined. 9. That apart, the decision of this Court in Prof. Yashpal and another vs. State of Chhattisgarh and others 2 and the amendment of the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions Act, 2004 made in the year 2010 would also require an authoritative pronouncement on the aforesaid question formulated, as set out above, besides the correctness of the view expressed in the of this Court in S. Azeez Basha (supra) which has been extracted above. 10. Ordinarily and in the normal course the judicial discipline would require the Bench to seek a reference of this matter by a Five Judges Bench. However, having regard to the background, as stated above, when the precise question was already referred to a Seven Judges Bench and was, however, not answered, we are of the view that the present question, set out above, should be referred to a Bench of Hon’ble Seven Judges.
