Most importantly, her testimony is corroborated by PW2, PW3 and PW4. [Para 14][249-D-F] 2. To determine the culpability of appellants whether they are guilty for the offence of murder, punishable under Section D 302, or whether they are criminally liable under the less severe Section 304, IPC, several previous judgements of this Court may be relied upon. [Paras 15 and 16][249-G-H] Virsa Singh v. State of Punjab [1958] SCR 1495; State of Andhra Pradesh v. Rayavarapu Punnayya & Anr. E [1977] SCR 1 601 and Pulicherla Nagaraju @ Nagaraja Reddy v. State of Andhra Pradesh (2006) 11 SCC 444 : [2006] 4 Suppl. SCR 633 – relied on. 3. The requirement of Section 300 IPC thirdly is fulfilled if the prosecution proves that the accused inflicted an injury which F would been sufficient to have resulted in death of the victim. The determinative fact would be the intention to cause such injury and what was the degree of probability (gravest, medium, or the lowest degree) of death which determines whether the crime is culpable homicide or murder. [Para 18][256-E] G 4. The case law on the issue of the nature of injury being so dangerous as to result in death (Section 300 fourthly), have emphasised on the accused’s disregard to the consequences of the injury, and an element of callousness to the result, which denotes or signifies the intention. [Para 19][256-F] H PRASAD PRADHAN & ANR. v. THE STATE OF 243 CHHATTISGARH State of Madhya Pradesh v. Ram Prasad, [1968] 2 SCR A 522 and Santosh S/o. Shankar Pawar v. State of Maharashtra (2015) 7 SCC 641 : [2015] 4 SCR 962– relied on. 5. In the present case, there is no difficulty in accepting the concurrent findings that are firstly, the appellants were B aggressors; secondly, they attacked the deceased, with axes; thirdly, the deceased was unarmed; fourthly, during the attack, the victim’s daughter, PW1 reached the spot, and tried to dissuade the appellants; fifthly, the appellants continued their assault on the victim and also attacked the witness with an axe; sixthly, since C three injuries sustained by the appellant, were on the head, he fell down; seventhly, the victim was rushed to the hospital, and had to be shifted to another speciality hospital, for surgery. Eighthly, the deceased was not able to record his statement; he was never discharged and died in the hospital, after 20 days. Lastly, the doctor who conducted the post-mortem (PW-14), D stated that the injuries were caused by a hard and blunt object, and death of the deceased was due to cardio respiratory failure “as a result of multiple injuries on his body and their complications”. Apart from the head, there were several other injuries, in the form of abrasions, contusions on the elbow, the lower back, E fracture of rib cage, etc. [Para 20][257-F-H; 258-A-B] 6. Then, the issue is whether in this case the factual matrix is covered by Exception 4 of Section 300. It is clear that the testimonies of the two important eyewitnesses, PW1 and PW2, establish that when the deceased was levelling the septic tank F on his property, the accused/appellants started abusing him; he asked them not to.
