The court must ensure, that miscarriage of justice is avoided, and if the facts and circumstances of a case so demand, then the benefi t of doubt must be given to the accused, keeping in mind that a reasonable doubt is not an imaginary, trivial or a merely probable doubt, but a fair doubt that is based upon reason and common sense.” 66. It may be true as said by this Court, speaking through Justice Krishna Iyer in Dharm Das Wadhwani v. State of Uttar Pradesh reported in (1974) 4 SCC 267, that the rule of benefi t of reasonable doubt does not imply a frail willow bending to every whiff of hesitancy. Judges are made of sterner stuff and must take a practical view of the legitimate inferences fl owing from the evidence, circumstantial or direct. Even applying this principle, we have a doubt as regards the complicity of the appellant-convict in the crime. 67. In the present case, it is diffi cult to rest the conviction solely based on the two dying declarations. At the cost of repetition, the PW-2 has been otherwise also not believed by the High Court. IRFAN @ NAKA v. THE STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH 821 [J. B. PARDIWALA, J.] 68. As discussed above, the oral evidence of the PW-4 Soni, also does not inspire any confi dence. We are not satisfi ed that the prosecution has proved its case against the appellant-convict beyond reasonable doubt. 69. We, therefore, allow these appeals and acquit the appellant-convict of all the charges levelled against him. The appellant-convict is, therefore, directed to be released forthwith provided he is not required in connection with any other case or cases. Headnotes prepared by: Appeals allowed. Divya Pandey
