In other words, the evidence of the circumstance simpliciter that the appellant pointed out to the Investigating Officer the place where he threw away the weapon of offence i.e., knife would be admissible as ‘conduct’ under Section 8 irrespective of the fact whether the statement made by the 200 [2024] 6 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports accused contemporaneously with or antecedent to such conduct falls within the purview of Section 27 of the Evidence Act. iii. Discovery of weapon under Section 27 of the Evidence Act 57. In Madan Singh v. State of Rajasthan, 1979 SCC (Cri) 56, it was observed that where the evidence of the Investigating Officer who discovered the material objects is convincing, the evidence as to discovery need not be rejected on the ground that the panch witnesses did not support the prosecution version. Similar view was expressed in Mohd. Aslam v. State of Maharashtra, (2001) 9 SCC 362. 58. In Anter Singh v. State of Rajasthan, (2004) 10 SCC 657, it was further held: - “10. … even if Panch witness turn hostile which happens very often in criminal cases, the evidence of the person who effected the recovery would not stand vitiated.” 59. Even while discarding the evidence in the form of discovery panchnama, the conduct of the appellant herein would be relevant under Section 8 of the Evidence Act. The evidence of discovery would be admissible as conduct under Section 8 of the Evidence Act quite apart from the admissibility of the disclosure statement under Section 27 of the Evidence Act, as this Court observed in A.N.

The evidence of the circumstance, simpliciter, that the accused pointed out to the police officer, the place where the dead body of the kidnapped boy was found and on their pointing out the body was exhumed, would be admissible as conduct under Section 8 irrespective of the fact whether the statement made by the accused contemporaneously with or antecedent to such conduct falls within the purview of Section 27 or not as held by this Court in Prakash Chand v. State (Delhi Admn.) [(1979) 3 SCC 90 : 1979 SCC (Cri) 656 : AIR 1979 SC 400]. Even if we hold that the disclosure statement made by the accused-appellants (Ex. P-15 and P-16) is not admissible [2024] 6 S.C.R. 201 Anees v. The State Govt. of NCT under Section 27 of the Evidence Act, still it is relevant under Section 8. …” 60. In the State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu alias Afsan Guru, (2005) 11 SCC 600, the two provisions i.e. Section 8 and Section 27 of the Evidence Act were elucidated in detail with reference to the case law on the subject and apropos to Section 8 of the Evidence Act, wherein it was held: “205.
