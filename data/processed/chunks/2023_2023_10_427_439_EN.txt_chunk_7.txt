However, in the present case, as we have observed, the Appellant was appointed as a casual worker in 1991. While the services of other co-employees were regularised, that of the Appellant and some others was left out. The High Court in its dated 03.09.2010 passed F in Writ Petition No. 17892 of 2010 has also recorded the Respondents’ submissions that resolutions pertaining to the Appellant’s absorption are already in place and the same have been sent for necessary approval. Therefore, the rendered in Umadevi (supra) will not apply to the facts and circumstances of the present case. G 25. Now, coming to the Reasoned dated 07.03.2012 passed by Respondent No. 2 herein, which states that in pursuance of the High Court’s dated 24.08.2009 to not to give effect to the instruction of the Labour Department (pertaining to regularisation of casual employees) as communicated in the circulars dated 13.08.1979, 28.08.1980 and 13.03.1996; the Appellant’s services cannot be regularised. However, H OM PRAKASH BANERJEE v. THE STATE OF WEST BENGAL 437 & ORS.

Moreover, as has been observed above, the Respondents had also submitted before the High Court in Writ Petition No. 17892 of 2010 that resolutions pertaining to the Appellant’s absorption are already in place B and the same have been sent for necessary approval. Apart from this, as is evident from the facts and circumstances mentioned above, the non-regularisation of the services of the Appellant in the present case, is, in our view, a violation of the fundamental rights of equality before law and equality of opportunity in matters relating to employment under the State, as enshrined under Article 14 and Article 16(1) of the C Constitution, respectively.
