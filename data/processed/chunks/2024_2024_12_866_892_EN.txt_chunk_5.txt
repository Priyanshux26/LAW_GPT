4B.4 Even if the impugned notification is found to be unconstitutional, the appellant would still be bound by Section 43(1) of the MCFA, 1959. The appellant has not challenged the vires of the said section. 4B.5 This Court and various High Courts, it is submitted, have recognized court fees as a state subject. Reference is made to decisions of this Court in Salem Advocate Bar Assn. (II) v. Union of India;9 High Court of Madras v. MC Subramaniam10 as being entirely distinguishable from the present facts. For High Courts, reliance is placed on Rangathan v. In the Court of District Judge, Trichirapalli; K.S Periyaswamy v. State of Karnataka;11 Maharishi Shankarrao Mohite-Patil Sahakar Sakhar Karkhana Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra.12 In these s, it is submitted that the respective High Courts permitted a hundred percent refund of court fees recognizing that the settlement arrived at was under the LSA Act, 1987. 8 Hereinafter, MCFA, 1959 9 [2005] Supp. 1 SCR 929 : (2005) 6 SCC 344 10 [2021] 1 SCR 552 : (2021) 3 SCC 560 11 2019 SCC OnLine Kar 3032 12 2019 SCC OnLine Bom 628 874 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 4B.6 It was also submitted that subsequently, in 2018, a provision, identical to Section 16 CFA, 1870 came to be inserted into the MCFA, 1959 by Maharashtra Act No. X of 2018. 4B.7 In view of the above submissions, it is prayed that the High Court has rightly rejected the challenge to the impugned notification, on grounds of inconsistency with Section 16 of the CFA, 1870. QUESTION FOR CONSIDERATION 5. The question presented for this Court’s adjudication was, considering the submissions as afore-stated is whether in view of the inconsistency between the CFA, 1870 and the MCFA, 1959, if any, would the appellant be entitled to a complete refund of court fees per the former, since it is a Central legislation? Allied thereto, would be the question of whether the Maharashtra State Legislature could have enacted the provision and brought out a notification giving refunds in ways contrary to and distinct from the manner and method provided in the Central Legislation? RELEVANT PROVISIONS 6. As is clear from the above, the present case involves the interpretation of various legislative provisions falling within both Central and State Legislations. For reference, they are extracted hereinbelow :- “CONSTITUTION OF INDIA PART XI RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNION AND THE STATES CHAPTER I.—LEGISLATIVE RELATIONS Distribution of Legislative Powers “246.
