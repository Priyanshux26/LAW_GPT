It was further stated that the opportunity must be real where the counsel is given sufficient and adequate time to prepare. 20.5. In Bashira [Bashira v. State of U.P. (1969) 1 SCR 32 : AIR 1968 SC 1313 : 1968 Cri LJ 1495] as well as in Ambadas [Ambadas Laxman Shinde v. State of Maharashtra (2018) 18 SCC 788 : (2019) 3 SCC (Cri) 452 : (2018) 14 Scale 730], making substantial progress in the matter on the very day after a counsel was engaged as Amicus Curiae, was not accepted by this Court as compliance with “sufficient opportunity” to the counsel.” (emphasis added) In paragraph 31, norms were laid down by this Court, which read thus: “31. Before we part, we must lay down certain norms so that the infirmities that we have noticed in the present matter are not repeated: [2024] 12 S.C.R. 353 Ashok v. State of Uttar Pradesh 31.1. In all cases where there is a possibility of life sentence or death sentence, learned advocates who have put in minimum of 10 years’ practice at the Bar alone be considered to be appointed as Amicus Curiae or through legal services to represent an accused. 31.2. In all matters dealt with by the High Court concerning confirmation of death sentence, Senior Advocates of the Court must first be considered to be appointed as Amicus Curiae. 31.3. Whenever any learned counsel is appointed as Amicus Curiae, some reasonable time may be provided to enable the counsel to prepare the matter. There cannot be any hard-and-fast rule in that behalf. However, a minimum of seven days' time may normally be considered to be appropriate and adequate. 31.4. Any learned counsel, who is appointed as Amicus Curiae on behalf of the accused must normally be granted to have meetings and discussion with the accused concerned. Such interactions may prove to be helpful as was noticed in Imtiyaz Ramzan Khan [Imtiyaz Ramzan Khan v. State of Maharashtra (2018) 9 SCC 160 : (2018) 3 SCC (Cri) 721] .” (emphasis added) 20. Thus, the right to get legal aid is a fundamental right of the accused, guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution. Even under Section 303 of the CrPC, every accused has a right to be defended by a pleader of his choice. Section 304 provides for the grant of legal aid to an accused free of costs. When an accused has either not engaged an advocate or does not have sufficient means to engage an advocate, it is the trial court’s duty to inform the accused of his right to obtain free legal aid, which is a right covered by Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Sub-Section (1)of Section 304 reads thus: “304. Legal aid to accused at State expense in certain cases.—(1) Where, in a trial before the Court of Session, the accused is not represented by a pleader, and where it appears to the Court that the accused has 354 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports not sufficient means to engage a pleader, the Court shall assign a pleader for his defence at the expense of the State.
