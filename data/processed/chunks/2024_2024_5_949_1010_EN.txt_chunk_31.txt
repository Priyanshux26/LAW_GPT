75. However, nothing much turns on our restraint for there are weightier reasons to reject the contention of the review petitioners; and this, we say, to specifically answer question (c). 76. In paragraph 365 of Manoharlal [5-Judge, lapse] (supra) itself, it has been held by the Constitution Bench that Shailendra [3-Judge] (supra) did not have the occasion to consider certain aspects for which that decision cannot prevail. Learned senior counsel for the respondents, based on such statement, contended that Shailendra [3-Judge] (supra) stands overruled. This submission has been disputed by learned senior counsel for the review petitioners. According to them, Shailendra [3-Judge] (supra) has not been expressly overruled; only because of aspects referred to in paragraph 365 and the discussion preceding, it ceases to be a precedent. 77. We have not held Shailendra [3-Judge] (supra) to be per incuriam for the reason indicated above but the statement in paragraph 365 of Manoharlal [5-Judge, lapse] (supra) has to be given some meaning. Although it is true that Shailendra [3-Judge] (supra) was not expressly overruled by Manoharlal [5-Judge, lapse] (supra), what stands out as a direct impact of paragraph 365 thereof is that Shailendra [3-Judge] (supra), not having considered certain vital aspects and more particularly as to how the conjunction ‘or’ in sub- section (2) of section 24 of the 2013 Act has to be read as well as the proviso thereto, the very basis for Shailendra [3-Judge] (supra) 992 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports to declare Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) per incuriam stands removed. Since the reasoning for Shailendra [3-Judge] (supra) to declare Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) per incuriam does not survive, it would be unreasonable and inappropriate to hold that the consequential observation would nevertheless survive. Significantly, in Manoharlal [5-Judge, lapse] (supra), one does not find any observation of like nature as in paragraph 217 of Shailendra [3-Judge] (supra). 78. That apart, being members of a larger Bench of co-equal strength as in Shailendra [3-Judge] (supra), we are not precluded by any law from interpreting the last sentence of paragraph 217 of the said decision and to say what the Court exactly intended even if it is assumed notwithstanding what has been said in paragraph 365 of Manoharlal [5-Judge, lapse] (supra) that the observation in paragraph 217 survives. In our humble understanding, what the majority in Shailendra [3-Judge] (supra) intended to say is that if review petitions were pending on the date of the decision, i.e., 8th February, 2018, seeking review of decisions which had been rendered relying on the decision in Pune Municipal Corporation (supra), such review petitions could be entertained and considered on the basis of the discussion in Shailendra [3-Judge] (supra) declaring Pune Municipal Corporation (supra) per incuriam and the decisions reviewed; nothing more, nothing less. We do not think that the majority in Shailendra [3-Judge] (supra) could have and did, in fact, give a carte blanche to the land acquiring authorities to apply for review of decisions already made by courts relying on the decision in Pune Municipal Corporation (supra), even though the remedy of appeal or review had not been pursued earlier and without the successful landowners being on record before the court.
