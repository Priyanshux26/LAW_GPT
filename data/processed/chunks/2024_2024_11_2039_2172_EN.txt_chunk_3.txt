2043 State Bank of India & Ors. v. The Consortium of Mr. Murari Lal Jalan and Mr. Florian Fritsch & Anr. to misinterpret the observations made in the impugned . [Paras 129, 130] 1.3 The SRA not having infused the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore as per Clause 6.3.1(g) and S. No. 11 of the Implementation Schedule under Clause 7.7 within a period of 180 days from the Effective Date and within the multiple extensions granted therefrom, defaulted on its obligation towards the payment of CIRP costs (which include airport dues) under Clause 6.4.1 as well. [Para 132] 2. By not infusing the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore as per the Implementation Schedule of the Resolution Plan, the SRA breached the terms of the Resolution Plan which required a minimum liquidation value of Rs.113 Crore to be paid towards the Workmen and Employees’ Dues as well – Moreover, both the Provident Fund and Gratuity Dues amounting to Rs. 226 Crore should also have been paid by the SRA as per the dated 21.10.2022 of the NCLAT in fulfillment of its obligations, which it failed to do. [Para 140] 3.1 The NCLAT declined to accept the submission of the Appellant that on account of non-deposit of Rs.150 Crore as directed by this Court, the Corporate Debtor should be liquidated – This was based on the incorrect assumption that the direction of this Court to infuse to Rs.150 Crore in cash was only confined to the terms of the Lenders Affidavit dated 16.08.2023 – The Lender’s Affidavit could not have provided for conditions incompatible with the terms of the Resolution Plan – Such an affidavit would have been in direct contravention with s.31(1) of the IBC, 2016 – Therefore, the direction of this Court in its dated 18.01.2024 was w.r.t both the Lenders Affidavit and the underlying terms of the Resolution Plan – The same was so understood by all the parties involved. [Para 142] 3.2 The Lender’s Affidavit in precise terms stated that “Failing to comply with the conditions mentioned in Para 8(a) to (c) above, the Corporate Debtor should be directed to go into liquidation” – It was in this context that this Court stated that, “the SRA shall peremptorily on or before 31 January 2024, deposit an amount of Rs. 150 crores into the designated account of SBI, failing which the consequences under the Resolution Plan will follow” – Therefore, it is incorrect to contend that this Court neither considered nor expressed any opinion on the question of liquidation of the Corporate 2044 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Debtor – The consequence of non-implementation of the Resolution Plan by the SRA must necessarily be liquidation of the Corporate Debtor in accordance with s.33(3) of the IBC, 2016. [Para 143] 3.3 The SRA failed to infuse the first tranche payment of Rs. 350 Crore as envisaged in the Resolution Plan despite the Effective Date being fixed on 20.05.2022 – Consequently, the payment of CIRP costs, workmen and employees’ dues etc.
