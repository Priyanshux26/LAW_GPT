(viii) While deciding the question whether prejudice has been caused to the accused because of the omission, the delay in raising the contention is only one of the several factors to be considered. [Para 16][767-D-G; 768-A-C] E Tara Singh v. State 1951 SCC OnLine SC 49; Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade & Anr. v. State of Maharashtra (1973) 2 SCC 793 : [1974] 1 SCR 489; S. Harnam Singh v. State (Delhi Admn.) (1976) 2 SCC 819; Samsul Haque v. State of Assam (2019) 18 SCC 161 – relied on. F 2.1 The only circumstance brought on record against the present appellant is in the evidence of PW5, who stated that the appellant was standing outside near the gate of the gallery with a katta in his hand. No overt act was attributed to him. There is a long statement of the appellant under Section 313 of CrPC in G which as many as 42 questions were put to the appellant. Question no.13 is about what PW5 deposed. Admittedly, it was not put to the appellant that it is brought on record that he was standing outside near the gate of the gallery with a katta in his hand. It is true that the answer given by him to every question is “I don’t H 756 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 5 S.C.R. A know”. If all the circumstances put to the appellant in his statement under Section 313 CrPC are carefully perused, any person of ordinary intelligence will get the impression that none of the prosecution witnesses has stated anything against him. That is why one cannot find fault with the appellant when he gave standard answers to every question as nothing adverse against B him was put to him. In paragraph 13 of the written submissions by the appellant before the High Court, a specific contention was raised that the only circumstance appearing against the appellant was not put to him in the statement under Section 313 of CrPC. It is not in dispute that this part of the argument is not considered C by the High Court. The Trial Court has not reproduced the submissions made by the counsel appearing for the accused. [Para 10][760-F-H; 761-A-B] 2.2 The only alleged incriminating circumstance appearing against the appellant in the evidence produced by the prosecution D has not been put to him in his statement under Section 313 of CrPC and, therefore, he had no opportunity to explain the said circumstance. Moreover, his conviction is based only on this circumstance. [Para 11][761-C] 2.3 Only based on the version of PW5 regarding the E appellant’s presence with a weapon outside the premises where the offence took place, the involvement of the appellant has been held as proved. There is absolutely no other evidence against him. This is not a case where there are several incriminating circumstances appearing against the appellant in the evidence adduced by the prosecution. This is a case where there is only a F solitary circumstance appearing in the evidence against the appellant.
