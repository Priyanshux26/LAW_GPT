(iv) WP No.2871 of 2015 – Jameel A. Hussain and Others vs. State of Maharashtra and Others. 39. In Writ Petition No.2871/2015, the reservation of the land claimed by the petitioners was for DP Road. The possession of the developed portion of the reserved land was taken over by the said Corporation on 29th July 2004. The completion certificate was issued on 23rd August 2014. It is claimed in the petition that FSI in respect of surrender of land was granted but FSI in respect of amenity constructed thereon was never granted. Going by the averments made in the petition, though the petitioners claim to have surrendered the reserved land with amenity on 29th July 2004, the petitioners never applied for grant of 100% TDR in respect of the amenity. Even after the decision of the Apex Court in the case of 876 [2024] 9 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports Godrej & Boyce Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (supra) which is of 6th February 2009, the petitioners did not apply for grant of additional FSI/ TDR in respect of amenity surrendered in the year 2004 and for the first time by a letter dated 17th February 2012, the petitioners applied for grant of additional TDR. The proposal for grant of additional TDR was rejected on 30th January 2015. Thereafter the petition was filed. Thus, after surrendering the reserved land on 29th July 2004, the petitioners never claimed TDR in respect of the amenity developed by them till 17th February 2012. The application was made three years after the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Godrej & Boyce Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (supra). Considering this conduct of the petitioners which virtually amounts to abandonment of their right, no relief can be granted to the petitioners in this petition. (v) WP No.2107 of 2016 – M/s Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Pvt. Ltd. and Another vs. The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai and Others.– 40. In Writ Petition No.2107/2016, according to the case of the petitioners, they constructed DP Road. They surrendered the reserved land on 5th June 2007. Their Architects/ Licensed Surveyors made an application on 4th September 2009 for grant of 100% additional TDR in the light of the decision of the Apex Court. A legal notice was issued by their advocate on 7th December 2009. Thereafter, the petitioners took no steps and after a gap of 6½ years on 21st July 2016, the petitioners called upon the said Corporation to grant additional FSI/TDR. The correspondence made by the petitioners in the year 2009 was based on the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Godrej & Boyce Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (supra). The petitioners sought to rely upon the subsequent decision of the Apex Court dated 5th May 2016 in the case of Municipal Corporation [2024] 9 S.C.R. 877 Kukreja Construction Company & Others v. State of Maharashtra & Others of Greater Mumbai v. Natvar Parikh & Co. Pvt. Ltd. (Civil Appeal No.1479/2015) which followed the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Godrej & Boyce Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (supra).
