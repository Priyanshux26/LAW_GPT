[M. R. SHAH, J.] amendment brought in vide Finance Act, 2002, Section 158BD provided A that provision of Chapter-XIV-B of the Act would apply accordingly and therefore the provision of Section 158BC and 158BFA was attracted. It is submitted that insertion of “under Section 158BC” only makes it clear what was always existing under Section 158BD. 7.8 It is submitted that if the contention of the assessee that Section B 158BFA would not be attracted unless notice under Section 158BC is provided then for the period prior to the clarificatory amendment brought in prior to Finance Act, 2002, is accepted, in that case, the provision of Section 158BD will be rendered nugatory qua Section 158BFA. It is submitted that such an interpretation will result in absurdity and the whole C intention behind Section 158BD being on the statute book will be lost. 7.9 Now so far as the chargeability of interest under Section 158BFA prior to 01.06.1999 in case of persons issued notice under Section 158BC and the submission on behalf of assessee that since the interest only follows principal, the liability of payment of interest does not arise D as there was no liability to pay tax along with return, since at the relevant point of time, Section 140A did not apply to Section 158BC , there was no liability to deposit tax along with return, hence, there can be no levy of interest on that tax for mere failure to file return, it is submitted that the said contention runs contrary to the mandatory and compensatory language of Section 158BFA(1). Reliance is placed on Notes on Clauses E and the memorandum explaining amendment to Section 140A of the Act more particularly Clause 63 by which it was sought to amend Section 140A of the Income Tax Act. It is submitted that a conjoint reading of the Note on Clauses and the memorandum it is very clear that Legislature originally intended to make assessee liable to pay taxes and interest F when the return was filed under Section 139 or under Section 142 or under Section 148. It is submitted by virtue of amendment the Legislature proposed to make those assessees who are filing return under Section 158BC also liable to pay tax and interest under Section 140A. It is submitted that memorandum explaining the provisions of Finance bill further makes it clear that the existing provisions of Section 140A are G not applicable to Chapter XIV-B relating to assessment of income of block period in search and seizure cases. The said memorandum also recognizes that the admitted tax declared in return cannot be collected till the assessment is completed. Therefore, the Legislature intended to amend Section 140A by incorporating Section 158BC so as to make H 704 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 1 S.C.R. A liable those persons who are filing return under Section 158BC also. Thus, by virtue of the amendment, a new class of assessee was brought to the statute book whose income are subject to the assessment under Chapter XIV-B, in Section 140A compelling them to pay self-assessment tax.
