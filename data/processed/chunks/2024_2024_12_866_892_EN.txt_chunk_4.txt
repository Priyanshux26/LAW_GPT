872 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports 4A.2 The Constitution of India in its Federal structure provides for the distribution of powers as enumerated in the lists under Schedule VII. Administration of justice is Entry No.11 – A in List III. The process of settlement of disputes through alternative dispute resolution7 mechanisms is a concept embedded in the effective administration of justice, and, therefore the CFA, 1870 as also the legislations governing court fees in the States, are in concurrent operation. It, therefore, submitted that the State cannot be permitted to legislate to an extent such as it may repeal this Central Legislation. 4A.3 Section 21 of the LSA Act, 1987 specifically contemplates a reference to refund of court fees in terms of the provisions of CFA, 1870. 4A.4 It is submitted that Section 89 CPC was inserted into the statute book in 1999 empowered by the 129th Report of the Law Commission of India. The statement of objects and reasons thereof prescribes the intention of encouraging the settlement of disputes through ADR mechanisms. If the contention of the State is accepted that the CFA, 1870 is repealed in so far as the State of Maharashtra is concerned and the MCFA, 1959 holds the field, it is submitted that the intention of the legislature in inserting Section 89 into the CPC, would be frustrated. 4A.5 It is submitted that in to protect the fulcrum of the insertion of Section 89 CPC, harmonious construction of all the statutes is to be adopted. Without doing the same, the said section would be rendered otiose. 4B. Submissions on behalf of Respondent(s) 4B.1 The CFA, 1870 was an ‘existing law’ within the meaning of Article 366 of the Constitution of India, and by virtue of Article 372 of the Constitution, it continued to operate as law till such time ‘until altered or repealed or amended by a competent legislature.’ 4B.2 The erstwhile State of Bombay, being the competent state legislature as described under Article 372 read with Article 246(2) 7 Hereinafter, ADR [2024] 12 S.C.R. 873 Sanjeevkumar Harakchand Kankariya v. Union of India & Ors. superseded the CFA, 1870 with the BCFA, 1959, renamed the Maharashtra Court Fees Act,8 by an amendment in 2012. Section 49 of the MCFA, 1959 read with Schedule 4 thereof, explicitly repealed the CFA, 1870 in so far as Entries 3 and 66 of the List II of the Constitution are concerned. As such, CFA, 1870 has no application in the State of Maharashtra, which would, obviously, include Section 16 thereof, which provides for 100% refund of court fees if the case is settled through one of the modes mentioned in Section 89, CPC. 4B.3 Section 43 of the MCFA,1959 governs the refund of court fees in the circumstances specified therein. The impugned notification dated 8th May, 2013 was passed under sub-section 2 of Section 43, which specifies hundred percent repayment of court fees in certain specified circumstances- relating to social and welfare legislations, and for other matters it provides for fifty percent, and in yet other cases, the refund percentage is twenty-five.
