Hence, relying upon the following s the assessee has sought for the appeal to be dismissed: ‘1. Prabhat Zarda Factory v. Commr. Of Central Excise [2004 (163) ELT 485 (Tri-Delhi) 2. Suresh Enterprises v. Commr. Of Central Excise, decided on 06.07.2006. 3. Yogesh Associates v. CCE, Surat-II (2005(188) ELT 251 (SC). 4. Gopal Zarda Udyog v. CCE, New Delhi 2005 (188) ELT 251 5. Dharam Pal Satyapal v. CCE New Delhi [2005 (183) ELT 241 (SC).’ DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS 119. Heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and on perusal of the record it would emerge therefrom that the Form No.1 dated 05.03.2015 submitted by the assessee before the jurisdictional Central Excises Division, Kundli, it had declared that they were manufacturing ‘Mahapasand zarda/jarda scented tobacco’. On 17.03.2015, Form No.2 was submitted by the assessee for the period 10.03.2015 to 31.03.2015, and duty was paid for the said period as per declaration in Form No.1. On 13.05.2015 the Department by Panchnama on the same date, drew samples of the product of the assessee’s product i.e., ‘Mahapasand zarda/jarda scented’ 646 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 13 S.C.R. manufactured and forwarded the same to CRCL who by the opinion dated 23.05.2015 opined as under: “TEST REPORT: “The sample is in form of brown coloured dried pieces of vegetable matter. It is a preparation containing tobacco, lime and fl avouring agents. It is other than Jarda Scented Tobacco. It has the characteristic of Khaini”. 120. Based on the said report the Department by communication dated 27.04.2015 informed the assessee, the product being manufactured by the assessee is classifi able under Chapter sub-heading 2403 9910 as ‘chewing tobacco (other than fi lter Khaini)’ and as such called upon the assessee- respondent to show cause as to why the Form No.1 dated 05.03.2015 should not be rejected as the product manufactured by the respondent-assessee fell in the category of ‘chewing tobacco (other than fi lter Khaini)’ and not under sub-heading 2403 9930 – ‘zarda/jarda scented tobacco’. Accordingly, the assessee started submitting Form No.1 declaring the product manufactured by it as ‘chewing tobacco’. This Court has consistently held the common parlance test continues to be one of the determinative tests for the classifi cation of a product. In Commissioner of Central Excise v. Shri Baidyanath Ayurved chewing tobacco (2009) 12 SCC 419, this Court has held as under: “49. The primary object of the Excise Act is to raise revenue for which various products are diff erently classifi ed in the new Tariff Act. Resort should, in the circumstances, be had to popular meaning and understanding attached to such products by those using the product and not to be had to the scientifi c and technical meaning of the terms and expressions used. The approach of the consumer or user towards the product, thus, assumes signifi cance. What is important to be seen is how the consumer looks at a product and what is his perception in respect of such product. The user’s understanding is a strong factor in determination of classifi cation of the products.
