34. Words and Phrases: “Amenity” and “development” – Meaning of, in the context of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning C Act, 1966. Dismissing the appeal, the Court HELD: 1.1. The law of abandonment is based upon the maxim invito beneficium non datur. It means that the law confers upon a man no rights or benefits which he does not desire. [Para D 15][69-B] 1.2 What was cited by the Municipal Corporation in their of rejection dated 27.11.1998 as an impediment for the grant of additional TDR was the subject matter of challenge in the first round. It was made by the very appellant No.1, though in respect E of another property. If the said decision in the first round had gone against appellant No.1, the rejection of the claim of the appellants for additional TDR on the basis of “prevailing policy” would have become final and unquestionable. [Para 17][69-F-G] 1.3 During the period from 1996 to 2009, the right to claim F additional TDR was in suspended animation. Thus, the appellants had to necessarily wait till the cloud over their right got cleared. To say that the wait of the appellants during the period of this cloudy weather, tantamount to abandonment, is clearly unjustified and unacceptable. Therefore, the finding recorded by the High Court that there was abandonment of claim by the appellants, is G not in tune with the law or the facts of the instant case and thus, is answered in favour of the appellants. [Para 18][69-G-H; 70-A- B] H 58 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 6 S.C.R. A 2.1 The word “amenity” as defined in s. 2(2) means several things including “recreation ground.” The word “development” includes under Section 2(7), mining or other operations in or over the land or the making of any material change in any building or land and reclamation, redevelopment and layout and sub-division of any land. [Para 38][76-D-E] B 2.2 To be precise, all activities undertaken by appellant No.1 through their Architects till the handing over of possession of the land were not towards the development of amenity and for the grant of Additional TDR. All those works were undertaken as part of the effort to make the Corporation accept the surrender C of land and to grant TDR. [Para 41][83-B-C] 2.3 It is only after the entry of Mayfair Housing, (of which appellant no.2 is a partner) into the picture, first with a letter of request dated 20.11.1996 to the Corporation to develop and maintain the Recreation Ground and then with the execution of D the Power of Attorney by appellant No.1 on 24.12.1996 that the idea of developing an amenity and seeking additional TDR had cropped up. But unfortunately, the Corporation made it clear to Mayfair Housing represented by appellant No.2 that he would not be entitled to Additional TDR, for the development of E Recreation Ground. In the letter dated 23.01.1998 it was made clear to Mayfair Housing that no TDR would be given to them. [Para 42][83-C-E] 2.4 When Mayfair Housing sent a letter dated 20.11.1996 to the Corporation seeking permission to develop and maintain the RG, they had nothing to do with the surrendered land.
