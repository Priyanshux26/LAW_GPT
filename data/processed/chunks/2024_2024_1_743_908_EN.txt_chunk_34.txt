The [2024] 1 S.C.R. 795 Bilkis Yakub Rasool v. Union of India & Others total fine payable by the respondents-convicts amounted to Rs.34,000/- each and, in default, they were liable to serve rigorous imprisonment for a period of thirty-four years (two years each for each count). The Trial Court had further directed that the ‘substantive sentences’ shall run concurrently and that the period of detention, if any, undergone by the respondents- convicts during the investigation, enquiry, trial, shall be set off against the terms of imprisonment, not being imprisonment in default of payment of fine imposed on the accused. That as per the nominal roll of respondent Nos.3 to 13, none of them had paid the fine sentenced by the Trial Court, making them liable to serve the penalty of rigorous imprisonment for default in payment of fine. But the respondents have neither paid the fine of Rs. 34,000/- to which each of them was sentenced, nor have they served any sentence in default of the non-payment of fine. It was submitted that the penalty of imprisonment ed for default in payment of fine stands on a completely different footing from the substantive sentence of imprisonment to be undergone for an offence. While under Section 432 of the CrPC, the Government has the power to remit ‘punishment for offence’, the executive discretion does not extend to waiving off the penalty of imprisonment for default in payment of fine under Section 64 of the IPC. In this regard, reliance was placed on Sharad Hiru Kolambe vs. State of Maharashtra, (2018) 18 SCC 718 (“Sharad Kolambe”) and Shantilal vs. State of M.P., (2007) 11 SCC 243 (“Shantilal”). 7.16. It was asserted that respondent No.1 while granting premature release failed to apply its mind and address the determinative factors outlined by this Court in Laxman Naskar. Thus, the s of remission are vitiated by the vice of arbitrariness for non-consideration of relevant facts and factors. According to learned counsel for the petitioners, a bare perusal of the s dated 10.08.2022 would make it clear that premature release was granted mechanically and arbitrarily, without giving due consideration to the factors enumerated in Laxman Naskar, qua each of the respondents-convicts. That the (s) dated 10.08.2022 are conspicuous in their silence on the behavior and the following acts of misconduct of each of the respondents- convicts, including the offences committed while on parole/ furlough, namely,: 796 [2024] 1 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports i. Case Crime No.1121001200158/2020 was registered against the respondent-convict, Mitesh Chimanlal Bhatt, under Sections 354, 304 and 306 of the IPC, committed on 19.06.2020 during parole/furlough; and ii. Case Crime No.02/2015 was registered against the respondent-convict, Rameshbhai Rupabhai Chadana under the Prisons Act. 7.17. It was further submitted that it is trite that in cases where a convict has been sentenced to more than one count of life imprisonment, he can only be released if remission is duly granted as per law for each count of life imprisonment. That it is a matter of record that the respondents-convicts were sentenced on fifteen counts of life imprisonment.
