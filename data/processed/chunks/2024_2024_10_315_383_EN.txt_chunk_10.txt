Digital Supreme Court Reports 8.4 Both the requisitioning and sanctioning authorities have not considered that mens rea is absent which, as is well established, is a requisite to constitute a criminal offence unless explicitly excluded. Reference is made to Peoples’ Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India17 and Sanjay Dutt v. State through CBI.18 In referring to latter , reliance is placed on the holding that if a reasonable interpretation exists which permits the avoidance of penalty, Courts are bound to take that approach. 8.5 The appellant was not made an accused in the first module, i.e., FIR No.67/2016 nor in the second module (initiated by an alleged hawala transaction which took place on 22nd May 2018) and sanction in respect thereof was granted by the Central Government on 16th October, 2019. He was, in fact, made an accused in an independent transaction involving A-20 regarding which the sanction (impugned herein) was issued on 22nd July, 2020. 8.6 The proviso to Section 22A exempts a person who is not in charge of and responsible for the affairs of the company, from prosecution. The appellant contends that he has wrongly been roped into the proceedings even when he is a Munshi working as a daily wager. He is illiterate and does not understand business transactions. A-6 took undue advantage of his situation, once A-7 and A-14 stole his identity. 8.7 No particular role has been ascribed to the appellant. This case by the NIA has been thrust upon him given, (a) he is a director in the company which is A-20; (b) the said company allegedly received funds that were to be used by PLFI; (c) he hails from the same locality and is a distant acquaintance of Dinesh Gope who is the leader of the PLFI. 9. The stand of the respondent - Union of India, as can be understood from the materials on record and the written submissions, is that - 9.1 The sanction that has led to the present proceedings has been granted after following due process. The NIA recommended prosecution of the accused persons including 17 [2004] 1 SCR 232 : (2004) 9 SCC 580 18 [1994] Supp. 3 SCR 263 : (1994) 5 SCC 410 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 331 Fuleshwar Gope v. Union of India & Ors. the present appellant vide its letter dated 14th July, 2020.
