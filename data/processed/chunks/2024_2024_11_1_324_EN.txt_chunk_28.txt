Subsequently, Article 31C was amended by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 197620 to expand the protection of Article 31-C to laws framed in furtherance of any Directive Principle and not only Articles 39(b) and (c). This 16 [1986] 1 SCR 707 : (1986) 2 SCC 516 : 1986 INSC 40 17 [1996] Supp 2 SCR 230 : (1996) 4 SCC 49 : 1996 INSC 598 (“three-judge bench ”) 18 [1981] 1 SCR 206 : (1980) 3 SCC 625 : 1980 INSC 142 19 [1973] Supp. 1 SCR 1 : (1973) 4 SCC 225 : 1973 INSC 91 20 “Forty-Second Amendment” [2024] 11 S.C.R. 39 Property Owners Association & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. amendment to Article 31C by the forty-second amendment was invalidated by this Court in Minerva Mills for being violative of the basic structure of the Constitution. 18. Before the bench of three judges, Mr Nariman inter alia urged that the doctrine of revival, as it applies to ordinary statutes does not apply to a constitutional amendment. Hence, he urged that when the part of the forty-second amendment which amended Article 31C was invalidated, it did not result in the automatic revival of the unamended Article 31C. He argued that the decision in Minerva Mills proceeded on a concession that Article 31C remained in force and an unexplained assumption that the unamended Article 31-C (to the extent that it was upheld in Kesavananda Bharati)stood revived. He argued that the question never arose nor was it decided in the case or subsequently in Waman Rao v Union of India21 or Sanjeev Coke Manufacturing Co vs. Bharat Coking Coal Ltd.22 19. On the other hand, Mr Ashok Desai appearing for the respondents contended that the matter stood concluded by the decisions in Minerva Mills, Waman Rao and Sanjeev Coke, wherein revival of the unamended Article 31C was undisputed because it was an ‘obvious position of law’ and had held the field for a long period of time. 20. The three-judge bench of this Court observed since the decisions in Minerva Mills, Waman Rao and Sanjeev Coke were all rendered by a bench of five judges and the assumption that Article 31C remains in force was disputed, it would be appropriate to refer the matter to a larger bench. The reference was made in the following terms: “8. Having heard learned counsel for some time, we have formed the opinion that it would be more appropriate for a Bench of not less than five Judges to consider and decide these questions for an authoritative pronouncement on the same. The decisions in Minerva Mills [(1980) 3 SCC 625], Waman Rao [(1980) 3 SCC 587] and Sanjeev Coke [(1983) 1 SCC 147] are all by a Bench of five Judges. The question in the form it is raised by Shri F.S. Nariman did 21 [1981] 2 SCR 1 : (1980) 3 SCC 587 : 1980 INSC 216 22 [1983] 1 SCR 1000 : (1983) 1 SCC 147 : 1982 INSC 93 40 [2024] 11 S.C.R.
