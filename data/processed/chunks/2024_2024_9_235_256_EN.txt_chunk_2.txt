It is the further case of the appellants that they shared a very congenial and cordial relationship with Mantena Narasa Raju, Appa Rao Mukkamala and Suresh Anne, respondent Nos.2, 3 and 4, and they left the complete managerial control with them despite being the majority shareholders. They claim that they had no suspicion whatsoever against the said persons, but due to their failure in conducting Annual General Meetings during the financial years 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17, the Registrar of Companies struck off the name of M/s. Lexus Technologies Pvt. Ltd. from the Register of Companies on 21.07.2017, in exercise of power under Section 248 of the Act of 2013. The appellants claim that, it was only upon browsing the online portal, they came to know that the said persons had thereafter filed annual returns and financial statements for the years in question with false information, by erasing their shareholding from the records of the company. The appellants allege that the aforesaid persons committed various acts of oppression with the intention of grabbing the company property.
