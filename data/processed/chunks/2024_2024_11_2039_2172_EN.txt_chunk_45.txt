52 Crore and as per the Implementation Schedule, these claims were to be paid within 175 days from the Effective Date. However, the NCLAT vide its dated 21.10.2022 increased it to Rs. 113 Crore since it was the minimum liquidation value that they were entitled to as per the estimates of the RP. The final directions issued by the NCLAT in the aforesaid conveyed that the workmen and employees are entitled to the payment of unpaid PF and gratuity till the Insolvency Commencement Date and the RP was directed to compute such payment within 30 days. The RP had calculated such amounts to be Rs. 14 Crore towards PF and Rs. 188.7 Crore towards gratuity. It was submitted that neither the NCLAT dated 21.10.2022 nor the of this Court dated 30.01.2023 had provided any specific timelines for fulfillment of these additional liabilities which were cast upon the SRA. This is precisely why the SRA proposed to pay Rs. 14 Crore towards PF upfront in compliance with Section 11 of the PF Act and pay the Gratuity dues of Rs. 188.2 Crore in a staggered manner. 83. The counsel finally referred to the letter dated 16.08.2024 sent by MoCA which provided Security Clearance in respect of a proposed Director of the Corporate Debtor, Mr. Swapnil Jain. The validity period of this Security Clearance was stated to be co-terminus with the validity period of the AOC which was issued by the DGCA. D. ISSUES FOR DETERMINATION 84. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone through the materials on record, the following questions of law fall for our consideration: - i. Whether the Performance Bank Guarantee (PBG) could have been adjusted against the first tranche payment which was to be made under the Resolution Plan, within 180 days from the Effective Date, in contravention of the of this Court dated 18.01.2024, the terms of the Resolution Plan and the provisions of law? To put it in other words, whether the impugned of [2024] 11 S.C.R. 2107 State Bank of India & Ors. v. The Consortium of Mr. Murari Lal Jalan and Mr. Florian Fritsch & Anr. the NCLAT allowing the adjustment of the Performance Bank Guarantee (PBG) in lieu of payment of the first tranche could be said to be perverse? ii. Whether the non-implementation of the Resolution Plan by the SRA necessarily leads to the consequence of liquidation as provided under Section 33(3) of the IBC, 2016? iii. Whether the timely implementation of the Resolution Plan is also one of the objectives of the IBC, 2016? E. ANALYSIS 85. Before we proceed to advert to the rival submissions canvassed on either side and the issues outlined above, we must look into the preliminary objection raised on behalf of the SRA i.e., that the scope of an appeal under Section 62 of the IBC must be restricted to a “question of law”. In this regard, reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in IFCI Ltd. v. Sutanu Sinha and Others reported in 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1529 which dealt with the issue as to whether compulsorily convertible debentures could be treated as a “debt” instead of an equity instrument, to submit that the jurisdiction under Section 62 is restricted to a question of law akin to a second appeal.
