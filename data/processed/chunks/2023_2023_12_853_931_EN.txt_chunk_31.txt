This view of ours is also in conformity with the earlier decision of this Court in the case of Rashmi Kumar [(1997) 2 SCC 397 : 1997 SCC (Cri) 415] .” (emphasis supplied) 61. In Indore Development Authority v. Manoharlal (2020) 8 SCC 129, the Constitution Bench has exhaustively laid down the principle governing actus curiae neminem gravabit and restitution: “320. The maxim actus curiae neminem gravabit is founded upon the principle due to court proceedings or acts of court, no party should suff er. If any interim s are made during the pendency of the litigation, they are subject to the fi nal decision in the matter. In case the matter is dismissed as without merit, the interim is automatically dissolved. In case the matter has been fi led without any merit, the maxim is attracted commodum ex injuria sua nemo habere debet, that is, convenience cannot accrue to a party from his own wrong. No person ought to have the advantage of his own wrong. In case litigation has been fi led frivolously or without any basis, iniquitously in to delay and by that it is delayed, there is no equity in favour of such a person. Such cases are required to be decided on merits. In Mrutunjay Pani v. Narmada Bala Sasmal, AIR 1961 SC 1353, this Court observed that : (AIR p. 1355, para 5) “5. … The same principle is comprised in the Latin maxim commodum ex injuria sua nemo habere debet, that is, convenience cannot accrue to a party from his own wrong. To put it in other words, no one can be allowed to benefi t from his own wrongful act.” ××× ××× ××× 898 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 12 S.C.R. 324. In Mahadeo Savlaram Shelke v. Pune Municipal Corpn., (1995) 3 SCC 33, it has been observed that the Court can under its inherent jurisdiction ex debito justitiae has a duty to mitigate the damage suff ered by the defendants by the act of the court. Such action is necessary to put a check on abuse of process of the court. In Amarjeet Singh v. Devi Ratan, (2010) 1 SCC 417 : (2010) 1 SCC (L&S) 1108, and Ram Krishna Verma v. State of U.P., (1992) 2 SCC 620, it was observed that no person can suff er from the act of court and unfair advantage of the interim must be neutralised. In Amarjeet Singh v. Devi Ratan, (2010) 1 SCC 417 : (2010) 1 SCC (L&S) 1108, this Court observed : (SCC pp. 422-23, paras 17-18) “17. No litigant can derive any benefi t from mere pendency of the case in a court of law, as the interim always merges in the fi nal to be passed in the case, and if the writ petition is ultimately dismissed, the interim stands nullified automatically. A party cannot be allowed to take any benefi t of its own wrongs by getting an interim and thereafter blame the court. The fact that the writ is found, ultimately, devoid of any merit, shows that a frivolous writ petition had been fi led.
