f. Section 6A is not violative of Article 14 72. Section 6A confers citizenship to migrants from Bangladesh to Assam before 25 March 1971. Two yardsticks are discernible from Section 6A: (a) migrants must have entered Assam; and (b) the entry of migrants must be before the cut-off date of 25 March 1971. It first needs to be determined if the above two yardsticks are reasonable, have a nexus with the object and are in compliance with constitutional principles. 1284 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports 73. Parliament, even before the enactment of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 1995 has treated migration to the State of Assam as a cause of concern. Previous sections of this trace the enactment of the Immigrants (Expulsion from Assam) Act 1950 and the IMDT Act which dealt with the specific problem of undocumented migration to Assam. The Central Government could have extended the application of the IMDT Act to any other State by a notification. However, no such notification was issued indicating that the immigration to Assam presented the Union with a unique problem in terms of magnitude and impact. Though other states such as West Bengal (2216.7 km), Meghalaya (443 km), Tripura (856 km) and Mizoram (318 km) share a larger b with Bangladesh as compared to Assam (263 km), the magnitude of influx to Assam and its impact on the cultural and political rights of the Assamese and Tribal populations is higher. The data submitted by the petitioners indicates that the total number of immigrants in Assam is approximately forty Lakhs, fifty seven Lakhs in West Bengal, thirty thousand in Meghalaya and three Lakh and twenty five thousand in Tripura.129 The impact of forty lakh migrants in Assam may conceivably be greater than the impact of fifty seven lakh migrants in West Bengal because of Assam’s lesser population and land area compared to West Bengal. 74. Similarly, the cut-off date of 25 March 1971 is also rational. Even before the enactment of Section 6A, the IMDT Act defined an ‘illegal immigrant’ as a person who entered India on or after 25 March 1971 without travel documents. As noted above, the IMDT Act was not specific in its application to Assam. The enactment defined the phrase illegal immigrant for all States though the Central Government did not extend the provisions of the Act to other States. On 25 March 1971, the Pakistani Army launched Operation Search Light to curb the Bengali nationalist movement in East Pakistan.130 The migrants before the operation were considered to be migrants of partition towards which India had a liberal policy. Migrants from Bangladesh after the said date were considered to be migrants of war and not partition. Thus, the cut-off date of 25 March 1971 is reasonable. 129 See Report of Governor of Assam Lt.
