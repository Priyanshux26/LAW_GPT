However, the same cannot be examined in a strait-jacket/sealed compartment for the peculiar facts and circumstances of every case have to be carefully and individually appreciated. Thereafter, the Court concerned has to take a call as to whether the request made is genuine or, more importantly, whether refusal to accede to such request may lead to an eventual miscarriage of justice. It must not be lost sight of that ultimately, procedural technicalities have to give way to substantive justice. Procedure, well and truly, is only the handmaiden of justice.7 The discretion granted to Courts has to be exercised on a case-specific basis. Undisputedly, ‘procedural laws are primarily intended to achieve the ends of justice and, normally, not to shut the doors of justice for the parties at the very threshold’.8 16. In the present instance, we find that the sequence of events clearly indicates that the, respondent cannot be said to be solely at fault for as it was under the impression that the suit already stood disposed 7 For reference, peruse, inter alia, State of Gujarat v Ramprakash P Puri [1970] 2 SCR 875; Sushil Kumar Sen v State of Bihar (1975) 1 SCC 774, and the more recent, State v M Subrahmanyam (2019) 6 SCC 357 8 Mahadev Govind Gharge v The Special Land Acquisition Officer, Upper Krishna Project [2011] 8 SCR 829 1416 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports of and thus, there was no requirement/occasion to file the Written Statement. Admittedly, the case was listed suddenly after a prolonged gap on 17.01.2017, whereafter that the respondent filed an appropriate application. Moreover, the reports dated 25.01.2017 and 11.05.2023 submitted by the Registry of the High Court indicate that (a) the official website of the High Court did indeed state that the suit had been disposed of on 01.03.2000, and; (b) the High Court could not, for reasons best known to it alone, trace out any s in the file of the suit pre-17.01.2017. Stricto sensu, the situation that prevailed is a direct result of the confusion created by the Registry of the High Court. In this view, it would be improper to not permit the taking on record of the Written Statement of the respondent apropos the suit. 17. We, thus, find that discretion has rightly been exercised by the Division Bench of the High Court in favour of the respondent. We are in agreement with the reasons assigned by the Division Bench for setting aside the learned Single Judge’s dated 12.06.2023. 18. Payment of costs ed to be paid to the appellant by the High Court be made within ten days. 19. The High Court is requested to proceed with the matter keeping in mind the suit being of the year 1999 without giving any time/ indulgence to any of the parties, in accordance with law. We clarify that we have not expressed any opinion on the merits of the matter. 20. The appeal is dismissed in the above terms. POST-SCRIPT: 21. We request the High Court to take appropriate steps, on the administrative side, to ensure that what has emerged from the reports dated 25.01.2017 and 11.05.2023 does not recur for any other case.
