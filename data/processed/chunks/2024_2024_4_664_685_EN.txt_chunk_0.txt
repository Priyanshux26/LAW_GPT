[2024] 4 S.C.R. 664 : 2024 INSC 327 Pernod Ricard India (P) Ltd. v. The State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors. (Civil Appeal Nos. 5062-5099 of 2024) 19 April 2024 [Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha* and Aravind Kumar, JJ.] Issue for Consideration Issue as regards the applicability of the relevant rule for imposition of penalty. Whether it was the rule that existed when the violation occurred during the license period of 2009-10 (rule 19 of Madhya Pradesh Foreign Liquor Rules, 1996, before the amendment) or the rule 19 that was substituted by an amendment in 2011 when proceedings for penalty were initiated. Headnotes Madhya Pradesh Foreign Liquor Rules, 1996 – r.19 – Penalties – Permissible limits of loss of liquor in transit due to leakage, evaporation, wastage etc. – During the relevant license period of 2009-2010 when the violation occurred, r.19 provided that if permissible limits of loss of liquor exceeded, imposition of penalty was to be about four times the maximum duty payable on foreign liquor – However, no action was initiated against the appellant during the relevant license period– r.19 was substituted by an amendment in 2011 reducing penalty to an amount not exceeding the duty payable on foreign liquor – Demand notice issued in 2011 – Payment of penalty, if to be as per the repealed r.19 or the substituted r.19: Held: Penalty to be imposed on the appellants will be on the basis of r.19 as substituted on 29.03.2011 – A repealed provision will cease to operate from the date of repeal and the substituted provision will commence to operate from the date of its substitution, subject to specific statutory prescription – The operation of a subordinate legislation is determined by the empowerment of the parent act – The legislative authorization enabling the executive to make rules prospectively or retrospectively is crucial – Without a statutory empowerment, subordinate legislation will always commence to operate only from the date of its issuance and at the same time, cease to exist from the date of its deletion or withdrawal – Even * Author [2024] 4 S.C.R. 665 Pernod Ricard India (P) Ltd. v. The State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors. s.63 of the M.P. Excise Act, 1915 does not provide continuation of a repealed provision to rights and liabilities accrued during its subsistence – Further, r.19 which was substituted on 29.03.2011 was not notified to operate from any other date by the Government – If the amendment by way of a substitution in 2011 was intended to reduce the quantum of penalty for better administration and regulation of foreign liquor, there is no justification to ignore the subject and context of the amendment and permit the State to recover the penalty as per the unamended Rule – Purpose of the amendment was to achieve a proper balance between crime and punishment or the offence and penalty – Classifying offenders into before or after the amendment for imposing higher and lower penalties does not serve any public interest – The substituted Rule alone will apply to pending proceedings – Impugned of the Division Bench of the High Court set aside.
