In the case of Harvinder Singh alias Bachhu v. State of Himachal Pradesh4, this Court held as below: - “18. Character and reputation do have an element of interconnectivity. Reputation is predicated on the general traits of character. In other words, character may be subsumed into reputation. Courts are not expected to get carried away by the mere background of a person especially while acting as an appellate forum, when his conduct, being a relevant fact, creates 3 [2023] 2 SCR 746 : 2023(4) SCALE 478 4 [2023] 13 SCR 1157 : 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1347 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 387 Vinod Jaswantray Vyas (Dead) Through Lrs v. The State of Gujarat serious doubt. In other words, the conduct of a witness under Section 8 of the Evidence Act, is a relevant fact to decide, determine and prove the reputation of a witness. When the conduct indicates that it is unnatural from the perspective of normal human behaviour, the so-called reputation takes a back seat.” (emphasis supplied) 28. In the case of Chunthuram v. State of Chhattisgarh5, a three judge Bench of this Court discarded the testimony of a eyewitness on the ground that the deceased was known to the witness and claimed to have seen the assault on the deceased, but curiously, he did not take any proactive steps in the matter to either report to the police or inform any of the family members. The Court held that such conduct of the eyewitness is contrary to human nature. The relevant extracts from the are as follows: - “15. Next the unnatural conduct of PW 4 will require some scrutiny. The witness Bhagat Ram was known to the deceased and claimed to have seen the assault on Laxman by Chunthuram and another person. But curiously, he did not take any proactive steps in the matter to either report to the police or inform any of the family members. Such conduct of the eyewitness is contrary to human nature. In Amar Singh v. State (NCT of Delhi)[2020 SCC OnLine SC 826], one of us, Krishna Murari, J. made the following pertinent comments on the unreliability of such eye witness : (SCC para 32) “32. The conviction of the appellants rests on the oral testimony of PW 1 who was produced as eyewitness of the murder of the deceased. Both the learned Sessions Judge, as well as High Court have placed reliance on the evidence of PW 1 and ordinarily this Court could be reluctant to disturb the concurrent view but since there are inherent improbabilities in the prosecution story and the conduct of eyewitness is inconsistent with ordinary course of human nature we do not 5 [2020] 8 SCR 1071 : (2020) 10 SCC 733 388 [2024] 7 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports think it would be safe to convict the appellants upon the uncorroborated testimony of the sole eyewitness. Similar view has been taken by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Selveraj v. State of T.N. [(1976) 4 SCC 343] wherein on an appreciation of evidence the prosecution story was found highly improbable and inconsistent of ordinary course of human nature concurrent findings of guilt recorded by the two courts below were set aside.” 16.
