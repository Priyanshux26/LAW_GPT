Chapter Note 3, pertaining to Headings 3303 to 3307, now reads as follows: Chapter 33 ESSENTIAL OILS AND RESINOIDS, PERFUMERY, COSMETIC OR TOILET PREPARATIONS Notes: 1 – 2. …. 3. Headings 3303 to 3307 apply, inter alia, to products, whether or not mixed (other than aqueous distillates and aqueous solutions of essential oils), suitable for use as goods of these headings and put up in packings of a kind sold by retail for such use. 11.

Supreme Court Reports 12. The Act of 1985 also provides rules for interpretation of the First Schedule thereto. Rule 1 therein provides that classification of goods shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative Section or Chapter Notes. However, the admitted position is that the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System [Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN)], brought out by the World Customs Organization, reflects internationally accepted norms and is extensively used the world over for resolving disputes relating to tariff classification. It was adopted in 1983 and enforced in January, 1988. In Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise, Amritsar (Punjab) vs. D.L. Steels etc.,1 this Court noted that this multipurpose international product nomenclature harmonizes description, classification and coding of goods and, while the primary objective of the HSN is to facilitate and aid trade, it is also for other diverse purposes like internal taxes, monitoring import tariffs, quota controls, rules of origin, transport statistics, freight tariffs, compilation of national accounts and economic research and analysis. It was further noted that, in the present times, given the widespread adoption of the HSN by over 200 countries, it would be very difficult to deal with an international trade issue involving commodities, without adverting to the HSN. 13. As a matter of fact, the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Central Excise Tariff Bill, 1985, the precursor to the Act of 1985, recorded that a technical study group was set up to conduct a comprehensive inquiry into the structure of Central Excise Tariffs and the tariffs that were suggested by this group for 137 items were based on the internationally accepted nomenclatures in the HSN. Significantly, the Central Excise Tariff (Amendment) Act, 2004 (Act 5 of 2005), effected amendments in the First Schedule to the Act of 1985 with the sole intention of fine-tuning the tariff descriptions therein with the HSN.
