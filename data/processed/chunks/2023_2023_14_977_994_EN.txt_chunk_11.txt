It was impossible for the accused himself to produce Dr. Anil Kumar Singh and Dr. Kamlesh Kaitholiya, the authors of the Reports (Ex.P-72), in one day because the said experts are government servants and could not have attended the Court at the request of an accused in jail. The Trial Court treated the accused as if he is carrying a magic wand which is available to produce highly qualifi ed experts, who are government servants, on a phone call. There was no opportunity, in the real sense, to the appellant to cross-examine the experts. 22. For all the afore-stated reasons, we are of the considered view that the Trial Court conducted the trial in a hurried manner without giving proper opportunity to the accused to defend himself. Therefore, the of conviction and sentence passed by the Trial Court and affi rmed by the High 994 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2023] 14 S.C.R. Court is hereby set aside and the matter is remitted back to the trial court for de novo trial by aff ording proper opportunity to the appellant to defend himself. The trial court and the District Legal Services Authority, Indore, are directed to provide assistance of a senior counsel to the appellant to contest the trial on his behalf. 23. The appeals stand disposed of accordingly. Headnotes prepared by: Appeals disposed of. Ankit Gyan
