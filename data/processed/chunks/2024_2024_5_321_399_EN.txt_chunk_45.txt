While there is no doubt that the rate of interest applicable to the dues of the original plaintiff as determined by the High Court 386 [2024] 5 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports is correct, we think it is necessary to examine if the compound interest can be said to have continued to accrue even when FCIL was declared a sick company and was awaiting its revival before the BIFR. In other words, it is not the rate of interest but the period for which it is applicable, is the question that is to be determined. 116. We have discussed at length in the foregoing paragraphs of the the object behind the enactment of the 1985 Act. Sickness of industrial companies was considered to be a problem that affected the country at large, and thus the 1985 Act was enacted as per the policy directions contained in Article 39 of the Constitution to provide, inter alia, ameliorative steps for the revival of sick companies, and for the expeditious detection of potentially sick companies. In particular, we would like to mention that Section 19 of the 1985 Act provides that the scheme for rehabilitation of a sick company may provide for financial assistance to the sick company by way of loans, advances, reliefs or concessions or sacrifices from the Central Government, a State Government, a public financial institution etc. 117. In the present case, in pursuance of Section 19 of the Act, a number of decisions were taken by the CCEA on 09.05.2013 including the waiver of loans and interest thereon by the Central Government which ran into thousands of crores. As per the document F.No. 18055/13/2012-FCA-1 titled “Gist of the CCEA decisions dated 09th May, 2013” published by the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, it appears that the dues of the major unsecured creditors were settled at 30% of their dues as on 31.03.2003. Further, the dues of some other parties were settled without any interest or penalty, as otherwise the entire process of revival might have gotten derailed. 118. We have also discussed how Section 22(1) of the 1985 Act suspends any legal proceedings of the nature specified therein if they can potentially interfere with the consideration, sanction or execution of the rehabilitation scheme. The intention behind the sanction and execution of a rehabilitation scheme, without a doubt, is to increase the chances of the revival of the sick company in public interest. 119. Thus, on one hand we have the beneficial provisions of the 1985 Act, enacted to maximise the chances of revival of sick industrial companies, while on the other, we have the 1993 Act, which was enacted with the intention to ensure that small-scale industries are paid their dues in time. This object of the 1993 Act was sought to be [2024] 5 S.C.R. 387 Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited & Ors. v. M/s Coromandal Sacks Private Limited achieved by providing a high interest rate, with monthly compounding, so as to act as a deterrent for the buyers.
