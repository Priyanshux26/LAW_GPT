The only person who stated something in favour of the prosecution was PW-32 and it was in relation to Exhibit P-76. 123. It is on account of the slippery nature of their evidence that B the prosecution chose to send Exhibits P-66, P-76, P-90 and P-92 for examination by the handwriting expert. The handwriting expert was examined as PW-30 and his Report dated 16.09.1998 was marked as Exhibit P-68. 124. The specimen writings and signatures of A-5 were identified C by PW-30 as S1 to S31 and marked as Exhibit P-70. The specimen writings/signatures of A-7 were identified as S63 to S73A and marked as Exhibit P-75 series. 125. In the chief-examination, PW-30, the handwriting expert stated that in his opinion, the writer of the specimen writings/ signatures marked as S1 to S31 in Exhibit P-70, was the person responsible for D writing the red-encircled questioned writings in certain documents. The writer of the specimen writings and signatures identified in Exhibit P-70 was A-5 and not A-7. 126. Similarly, PW-30 identified the writer of the specimen writings in S40 and S41 marked as Exhibit P-73 as the person responsible for E writing Exhibit P-26. This related to K. Bhaskar Rao (PW-16) and the reference was to the chit in which the names of five firms were originally dictated and the names of two later included. Similarly, PW-30 identified in chief examination, the specimen writings marked in S42 to S62 and S93 to S96 in Exhibit P-74 as that of the person whose writings are F found in Exhibit P-26. S42 to S62 and S93 to S96 were that of A-6. 127. After thus relating the specimen writings and signatures of A-5, PW-16 and A-6 to some of the questioned writings, the handwriting expert made it clear even in his chief examination that it was not possible for him to express any opinion on the rest of the questioned items on the G basis of the material on hand. In other words, the handwriting expert examined as PW-30, did not go to the rescue of the prosecution even in his chief examination in so far as A-7 is concerned. His report marked as Exhibit P-68 did not implicate A-7 as the person in whose handwriting and signature, Exhibits P-66, P-76, P-90 and P-92 were written and signed. H A. SRINIVASULU v. THE STATE REP. BY THE INSPECTOR OF 71 POLICE [V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.] 128. Thus, there was a colossal failure on the part of the A prosecution to establish that Exhibits P-66, P-76, P-90 and P-92 were in the handwritings/signatures of A-7. This is despite the prosecution examining the bank officials as PW-22, PW-32, PW-40 and PW-41 and the handwriting expert as PW-30. 129. Unfortunately, the Trial Court adopted a very curious reasoning B in paragraph 91 (the only paragraph in which the reasons were given in this regard) that since he was a beneficiary of the money diverted to the account of Insecticides & Allied Chemicals, he must have had participation and knowledge that the demand drafts were purchased to cheat BHEL.
