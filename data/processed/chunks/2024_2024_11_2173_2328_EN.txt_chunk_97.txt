Obligations of parties to the Arbitration Agreement to constitute an independent and an impartial Arbitral Tribunal 9. I will now examine the principles that impinge upon the freedom to contract and limit of party autonomy. Before that, a necessary distinction needs to be drawn for clarity and certainty. 9.1 Distinct duties of Arbitrators and Arbitrating Parties. There are two distinct obligations. The first is the obligation of the parties to the agreement, and the second is the neutrality and objectivity that an arbitrator must maintain. The obligations on the parties to the arbitration agreement to constitute an independent and impartial arbitral tribunal is distinct from the objectivity and impartiality that an arbitrator(s) must himself maintain. The foundation of the former is within the statutory framework, coupled with certain public policy considerations. The latter is simply the duty to act judicially, it is not superimposed by any statute or public policy, but arises because of the very nature of the calling, i.e., to judge what is right and what is wrong. 26 Section 29. 27 Section 29A(2). 28 Section 29B. 29 Section 31(7)(a). 30 Section 33(4). 31 Section 34. 32 Sections 35 and 36. 33 Section 37. 34 Sections 38 to 43. 2300 [2024] 11 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Though the constitution of the arbitral tribunal is inextricably connected to the agreement between the parties, core duties of the arbitrator(s) in deciding the case is independent of the contract. The Arbitration Act provisions grounds to challenge appointment of an arbitrator at various stages, including after making of the award. The issue with which we are concerned is not about the arbitrator or the award of the arbitral tribunal, but about the legality of the contractual arbitration clause that enables one of the parties to unilaterally constitute the arbitral tribunal.
