14.7. The of sanction is a prerequisite as it is intended to provide a safeguard to a public servant against frivolous and vexatious litigants, but simultaneously an of sanction should not be construed in a pedantic manner and there should not be a hypertechnical approach to test its validity.” In the very same , it was observed that “grant of sanction is a sacrosanct and sacred act” whose aim is to protect a public servant against vexatious litigation. However, when the of sanction is (a) by a competent authority and (b) after due application of mind, it cannot be dealt with lightly or, in other words, summarily discarded. 40.3 Recently, in Judgebir Singh v. National Investigation Agency,56 while examining the application of Rules 3 & 4 of 2008 Rules, this court observed: “50. …We place emphasis on the expression “within 7 working days of the receipt of the evidence 56 [2023] 6 SCR 1 : 2023 SCC OnLine SC 543 368 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports gathered by the investigating officer under the CrPC”. This evidence which Rule 3 of the Rules, 2008 contemplates is the final report i.e., filed by the investigating agency under Section 173 of the CrPC. How can one expect the authority under sub section (2) of Section 45 to make its report containing the recommendations without looking into the chargesheet thoroughly containing the evidence gathered by the investigating officer. On the contrary, Rule 3 of the Rules, 2008 makes it explicitly clear that the authority under sub section (2) of Section 45 of the UAPA is obliged in law to apply its mind thoroughly to the evidence gathered by the investigating officer and thereafter, prepare its report containing the recommendations to the Central Government or the State government for the grant of sanction. The grant of sanction is not an idle formality. The grant of sanction should reflect proper application of mind. (Emphasis in original) (Emphasis supplied) 40.4 In State of Punjab v. Mohd. Iqbal Bhatti,57 the position of law was stated thus: “7. Validity of an of sanction would depend upon application of mind on the part of the authority concerned and the material placed before it. All such material facts and material evidence must be considered by it. The sanctioning authority must apply its mind on such material facts and evidence collected during the investigation. Even such application of mind does not appear from the of sanction, extrinsic evidence may be placed before the court in that behalf. While granting sanction, the authority cannot take into consideration an irrelevant fact nor can it pass an on extraneous consideration 57 [2009] 11 SCR 790 : (2009) 17 SCC 92 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 369 Fuleshwar Gope v. Union of India & Ors. not germane for passing a statutory . It is also well settled that the superior courts cannot direct the sanctioning authority either to grant sanction or not to do so…” 40.5 In State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu,58 this Court considered in extenso the provisions and scheme of the TADA in connection with the ‘2001 Parliament Attack’.
