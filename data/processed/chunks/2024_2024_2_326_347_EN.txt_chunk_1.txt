a declaration of G in the property, should have arisen only in the year 1990 – There is nothing on record to show any cause of action having arisen at this point in time, much less within the stipulated period of three years – As far as the maintainability of suit for declaration simpliciter in view of s.34 of SRA is concerned, in view of the proviso to s.34, the suit of the plaintiff-G could not have been decreed since the plaintiff sought for mere declaration without the consequential relief of recovery of possession – On a perusal of the plaint, it is evident that the plaintiff was aware that the appellant-V herein was in possession of the suit property and therefore it was incumbent upon him to seek the relief which follows – It is also noted that after the death of the life-estate holder-P in 2004, there was no attempt made by the original plaintiff to amend the plaint to seek the relief of recovery of possession – Thus, the impugned fails on both limitation and maintainability of suit – of the trial Court and First Appellate Court restored. [Paras 16, 17, 23, 26, 33] Adverse Possession – Claim of: Held: Person who claims adverse possession should show : (a) on what date he came into possession; (b) what was the nature of his possession; (c) whether the factum of possession was known to the other party; (d) how long his possession has continued; 328 [2024] 2 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports and (e) his possession was open and undisturbed – A person pleading adverse possession has no equities in his favour – Since he is trying to defeat the rights of the true owner, it is for him to clearly plead and establish all facts necessary to prove his adverse possession. [Para 20] Limitation – Adverse Possession – Dependence on limitation: Held: Modern statutes of limitation operate, as a rule, not only to cut off one’s right to bring an action for the recovery of property that has been in the adverse possession of another for a specified time but also to vest the possessor with title – The intention of such statutes is not to punish one who neglects to assert rights but to protect those who have maintained the possession of property for the time specified by the statute under a claim of right or colour of title.
