[Paras 60, 66] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 – s.46 – ‘Arrest how made’– “reason to believe” – Prisoner Transit Warrant (P.T. Warrant) u/s.267 – “other proceedings” – Whether a person, while in custody for a particular offence, can have a “reason to believe” that he may be arrested in relation to some other non-bailable offence – High Court of Rajasthan in Sunil Kallani reasoned that once a person is taken in custody in relation to an offence, thereafter it is not possible to arrest him in relation to a different offence as one of the essential conditions for arrest is placing the body of the accused in custody of the police authorities by means of actual touch or confinement – As there cannot be any actual touch or confinement while a person is in custody, he cannot have a “reason to believe” that he may be arrested in relation to a different offence: Held: Such view not agreed with – There are two fundamental fallacies in the reasoning adopted by the Rajasthan High Court – First, the High Court failed to consider the possibility of arrest of the person in custody in relation to a different offence immediately after he is set free from the custody in the first offence – The [2024] 9 S.C.R. 259 Dhanraj Aswani v. Amar S. Mulchandani & Anr. second fallacy in the reasoning of the High Court is that there can be no arrest of an accused in relation to a different offence while he is already in custody in relation to some offence – Ways by which a person who is already in custody may be arrested, enumerated – Incorrect to hold that a person, while in custody, cannot have a “reason to believe” that he may be arrested in relation to a different offence – Though a plain reading of s.46 makes it clear that arrest involves actual touch or confinement of the body of the person sought to be arrested however, arrest can also be effected without actual touch if the person sought to be arrested submits to the custody by words or action – A lawful arrest can be made even without actually seizing or touching the body – Actions or words which successfully bring to the notice of the accused that he is under a compulsion and thereafter cause him to submit to such compulsion will also be sufficient to constitute arrest – This is in conformity with the modality of the arrest contemplated u/s.46 – Procedure followed in cases where a person already in custody is required to be arrested in relation to a different offence, explained – When a person in custody is confronted with a P.T. Warrant obtained in relation to a different offence, such a person has no choice but to submit to the custody of the police officer who has obtained the P.T. Warrant – Thus, although there is no confinement to custody by touch, yet there is submission to the custody by the accused based on the action of the police officer in showing the P.T.
