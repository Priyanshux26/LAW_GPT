(dissenting)] The entire controversy cannot be viewed from the point of view of alcohol being used as a raw material and final product such as hand sanitizer containing alcohol – The potential misuse of alcohol cannot be the basis for interpreting an Entry such as Entry 8-List II – Ultimately, the “Fermentation Industries” have to be borne in mind which takes within its canvas only non- potable /“industrial alcohol” – The aspect of public health having a corelation to Entry 8-List II dealing with “intoxicating liquor” and the misuse of alcohol cannot be a guide while interpreting the content of the said Entry and therefore, its scope and ambit being amplified beyond what it really envisages as a field of legislation for the States to legislate upon.

[Para 140(i)] – [Per B.V. Nagarathna, J. (dissenting)] Item 26 of 1936 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports the First Schedule of the IDRA must be read excluding only what is contained in the expression “intoxicating liquors” as interpreted above in Entry 8-List II.
