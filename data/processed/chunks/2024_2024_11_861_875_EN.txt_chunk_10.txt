In paragraph 13, it is observed that the appellant ‘embarked on an inexorable quest’. This ought to have been avoided by the High Court. Paragraph 14 contains advice to the appellant to be circumspect and to exercise care and caution in future. The High Court could not have used a on the judicial side to advise individual Judicial Officers. That can only be done on the administrative side in an appropriate case. Describing the appellant’s approach as a ‘judicial misadventure’ in paragraph 14 was also improper. Therefore, the prayer made by the appellant for expunging remarks in paragraphs 13 and 14, which we have quoted in paragraph no.6 above, will have to be acceded to. We make it clear that the direction to expunge the remarks made against the appellant will not bind the administrative side of the High Court. 18. Accordingly, the appeals are allowed. Adverse remarks against the appellant in paragraphs 13 and 14 of the first impugned , which we have quoted in paragraph no.6 above, are hereby expunged. Result of the case: Appeals allowed. †Headnotes prepared by: Ankit Gyan
