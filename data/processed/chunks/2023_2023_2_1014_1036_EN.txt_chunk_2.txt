Suffice it to say that having carefully examined the record of the complaints in question, there is no illegality or infirmity in the s passed by the trial court F issuing summons against the appellant-Archbishop for the alleged offences. [Para 18][1031-C-F] 4. The High Court in its overzealous approach had travelled not only beyond the scope and ambit of Section 482 Cr.P.C and of Article 226 of the Constitution of India, but had crossed all the G boundaries of judicial activism and judicial restraint by passing such s under the guise of doing real and substantial justice. The jurisprudential enthusiasm and wisdom for doing the substantial justice has to be applied by the courts within the H CARDINAL MAR GEORGE ALENCHERRY v. STATE OF 1017 KERALA & ANR. permissible limits. The belief of self-righteousness or smugness A of the High Court in exercise of its powers of judicial review should not overawe the other authorities discharging their statutory functions. The court may not have to remind the High Courts that judicial restraint is a virtue, and the predilections of individual judges, howsoever well intentioned, cannot be permitted B to be operated in utter disregard of the well-recognized judicial principles governing uniform application of law. Unwarranted judicial activism may cause uncertainty or confusion not only in the mind of the authorities but also in the mind of the litigants. [Paras 28 and 29][1036-A-D] C S. K.
