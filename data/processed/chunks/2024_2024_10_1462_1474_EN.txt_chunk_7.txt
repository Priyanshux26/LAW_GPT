Section 18 of the Limitation Act cannot also be construed with pedantic rigidity in relation to proceedings under the IBC. This Court sees no reason why an offer of one-time settlement of a live claim, made within the 11 (1971) 1 SCC 67 [2024] 10 S.C.R. 1473 Vidyasagar Prasad v. UCO Bank & Anr. period of limitation, should not also be construed as an acknowledgment to attract Section 18 of the Limitation Act…” (emphasis supplied) 12. Both these factors, acknowledgment of debt in the balance sheet as well as in the OTS proposal, have been considered by NCLAT while dismissing the appeal. The relevant portion of the NCLAT findings, after considering balance sheet entries and OTS letter are as follows: “11.7 The Company’s balance sheet is prepared in the statutory format as per Schedule 3rd of the Companies Act 2013, which does not provide for giving the specific name of every secured or unsecured creditor. 11.8 It is further observed that the Corporate Debtor has not denied that there are no outstanding dues to the UCO Bank. A perusal of extract of register of charges submitted with ROC, at Sr. No. 3, shows that a charge of rupees one hundred and seventy-five crores created by the Corporate Debtor has not been satisfied and remains outstanding. 11.10 In the instant case, we also find that the Corporate Debtor issued a letter dated June 07 2016 (Annexure A Page 11 of their reply affidavit of R-1) wherein it has given OTS proposal. Based on the ratio of the judgement of Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Lakshmirattan Cotton Mills Co Ltd and further reiterated in Dena Bank’s case (supra) that there is an acknowledgement of subsisting liability of the Corporate Debtor. However, it may not necessarily specify the exact nature of the liability. But it indicates the jural relation between the parties, and in any event, the same can also be derived by implication. Further, the said Letter is not “without prejudice” basis and, therefore, amounts to an unequivocal acknowledgement of liability of the Corporate Debtor. A reading of the documents above reveals that the Corporate Debtor has acknowledged/subsisting liability to attract the provisions of Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963.” 13. Having examined the matter in detail, we are of the opinion that the findings arrived at by the Adjudicating Authority and NCLAT are 1474 [2024] 10 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports correct in law and fact. We find no merit in the appeal. The Civil Appeal No. 1031 of 2022 arising out of the NCLAT dated 04.10.2021 (Company Appeal (AT) (Insolvency) No. 238 of 2020) is dismissed accordingly. 14. No as to costs. Result of the Case: Appeal dismissed. †Headnotes prepared by: Mukund P Unny, Hony. Associate Editor (Verified by: Liz Mathew, Sr. Adv.)
