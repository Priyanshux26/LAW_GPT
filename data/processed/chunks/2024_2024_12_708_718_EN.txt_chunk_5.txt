stood rejected, and these s had attained a finality. 716 [2024] 12 S.C.R. Supreme Court Reports Late Shri Hari Shankar Tiwari (father of the respondent no.1) in fact gave his option on 23.07.1981 before the Prescribed Authority which was accepted by the Prescribed Authority and 33 Biswa 8 Bigha and 14.8 Biswansi was declared as a surplus area out of plot no.1353. 5. Meanwhile, not satisfied with the dismissal of the case right up to the Apex Court, an innovative ploy was devised, which is nothing short of an abuse of the process and has thus reached now to this Court. The present respondent no.1 (son of Late Hari Shankar Tiwari) moved an application on 23.04.1981 under Section 11 of the Act of 1960 stating that they were joint holders of the land and they were not given any notice by the Prescribed Authority. It was said that the passed by the Prescribed Authority in 1974 should be recalled, however, this objection of the respondent no.1 was rejected by the Prescribed Authority vide its dated 14.09.1981. The said dated 14.09.1981 was challenged by the respondent no.1 in an Appeal which was pending before the IVth Additional District Judge Hardoi and vide dated 16.11.1981 the IVth Additional District Judge Hardoi accepted the appeal and set aside the of the Prescribed Authority and remanded the matter back to the Prescribed Authority. 6. Now on this remand, the Prescribed Authority again issued a notice under Section 10(2) of the Act of 1960 to all the respondents and therefore, passed an dated 23.09.1985 holding that prior to cut off date, entire land shown in the notice belonged to Late Shri Hari Shankar Tiwari which had been partitioned through a private party settlement reduced to writing and through this family settlement the entire joint family, agricultural and non-agricultural land and property was divided by metes and bounds and since then each of the members of the erstwhile joint family have got their share separated, they ought to have been given a separate notice, which has not been given, as each of them were in exclusive possession of the property. 7. Against the above of the Prescribed Authority, the State filed an Appeal under Section 13 of the Act of 1960 before the District Judge, Hardoi and due to the subsequent amendment in the Act of 1960, the Appeal was transferred to the Court of Additional Commissioner (Judicial), Lucknow Division, Lucknow for decision in Appeal. The Additional Commissioner (Judicial), Lucknow Division, [2024] 12 S.C.R. 717 State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr. v. Suresh Chandra Tewari & Ors. Lucknow passed an on 18.10.1994 holding that once the matter had been settled and had attained finality, it should not have been raked up again. The entire case of the respondents rests on a family settlement which has been disbelieved in the earlier round of litigation. This finding as we know was upheld right up to Supreme Court, or at least till the High Court, as we have seen the petition was withdrawn in the Supreme Court in the first round of litigation.
