He pointed out that the COC and the adjudicating authority have already approved the resolution plan for the 2nd respondent-corporate debtor. He submitted that this Court had settled this issue in the case of Committee of Creditors of Essar Steel India Ltd. v. Satish Kumar Gupta & Ors.10 He relied upon a decision of the Hyderabad Bench of the NCLT in the case of State Bank of India v. Ghanshyam Surajbali Kurmi,11 which covered the issue. SUBMISSIONS OF INTERVENORS 10. Mr. Darius Khambata, the learned senior counsel appearing for the intervenor, also made detailed submissions. He pointed out that under 9 [2022] 15 SCR 536 : 2022 SCC Online SC 1276 10 [2019] 16 SCR 275 : 2019 SCC Online SC 1478 11 2022 SCC Online NCLT 14567 [2024] 7 S.C.R. 2153 BRS Ventures Investments Ltd. v. SREI Infrastructure Finance Ltd. & Anr. Section 128 of the Contract Act, the liability of a surety is co-extensive with that of the principal debtor unless there is something contrary to that in the contract. He relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of Laxmi Pat Surana v. Union of India & Anr12 on this behalf. He submitted that the guarantor’s liability is separate and distinct from the principal debtor as held by this Court in the case of Punjab National Bank Ltd. v. Shri Vikram Cotton Mills & Anr.13 This Court held that a binding obligation created under a composition under Section 391 of the Companies Act, 1956, between the company and its creditors, did not affect the liability of surety. He submitted that any variation in the contract between the creditor and guarantor does not discharge the principal debtor. If there is a variance made without the guarantor’s consent in the contract between the corporate debtor and the creditor, it amounts to the discharge of the guarantor as regards the transactions subsequent to the variance. He pointed out various provisions of the Contract Act regarding the discharge of a guarantor. Relying upon Section 60(2) of the IBC and a decision of this Court in the case of Lalit Kumar Jain,8 he urged that the IBC permits simultaneous petitions against the corporate debtor and corporate guarantor. He also invited our attention to Section 60(2) of the IBC. He relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of State Bank of India v. V. Ramakrishnan & Anr.14 He submitted that Section 140 of the Contract Act will be applicable only when the guarantor pays all that he is liable for under the contract of guarantee. He submitted that if the guarantor makes only a part payment of the debt, Section 140 will not have any application. He relied upon a decision of the Allahabad High Court in the case of Darbari Lal & Anr. v. Mahbub Ali Mian & Ors.15 He submitted that this proposition finds support even in the decision of the Allahabad High Court in the case of Shib Charan Das2 relied upon by the appellant.
