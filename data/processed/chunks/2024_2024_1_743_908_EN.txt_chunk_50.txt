Reliance was placed on the of this Court in Ram Chander, Sharad Kolambe, Devendra Kumar vs. State of Uttaranchal, (2013) 9 SCC 363 (“Devendra Kumar”) and Abdul Gani. 18.1. It was further submitted that the State of Gujarat has not considered the possibility of recidivism and whether there was any evidence of reformation of respondent Nos.3 to 13. That as per the record, respondent Nos.3 to 13 have not demonstrated [2024] 1 S.C.R. 817 Bilkis Yakub Rasool v. Union of India & Others any sign of reform and have not expressed any remorse for the crimes they have committed. That their applications for remission do not contain reference to feelings of remorse felt by them for their actions. The non-payment of fine is further indication of the absence of remorse. Also fresh cases have been registered against two of the respondents, and this serves as proof of their non-reformation. 18.2. It was also contended that reliance cannot be placed on documents, such as, letter dated 09.07.2022 of the C.B.I, wherein an affirmative opinion on remission was expressed as well as a letter produced by respondent No.3 containing the affirmative opinion of the Special Judge (C.B.I), Civil and Sessions Court, Mumbai as these documents have not been listed among the documents relied upon by the State of Gujarat while granting remission to the respondent Nos.3 to 13. 19. Ms. Aparna Bhat, learned counsel for the petitioner in Writ Petition(Crl.) No.319 of 2022 in her rejoinder submitted that the remission granted by the State of Gujarat to respondent Nos.3 to 13 was violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. That prison statistics from the year 2021 reveal that 66.7% of the convicts in Gujarat are undergoing life imprisonment, at least a fraction of whom have completed fourteen years of incarceration. That no special case has been made out either by the State of Gujarat or the Union of India as to why respondent Nos.3 to 13 are singularly entitled to remission over all of the other convicts. Reliance was placed on judgements in S. G. Jaisinghani vs. Union of India, AIR 1967 SC 1427(“S. G. Jaisinghani”) and E.P. Royappa vs. State of T.N., (1974) 4 SCC 3 (“E.P. Royappa”), wherein this Court held that arbitrary and mala fide exercise of power by the State would constitute a violation of Article 14 of the Constitution. That discretionary and en-masse remission on festive occasions was held to be impermissible in the case of Sangeet. 19.1. It was further submitted that there is no right to remission that a convict can necessarily avail. That remission must be an exercise of discretion judiciously by the concerned authorities. Reliance was placed onthe s of this Court inSangeet, V. Sriharan, State of Haryana vs. Mahender Singh, (2007) 13 SCC 606 (“Mahender Singh”); Mohinder Singh, Maru Ram and Shri Bhagwan vs. State of Rajasthan, (2001) 6 SCC 296 (“Shri Bhagwan”). 818 [2024] 1 S.C.R.
