194(2) – Thus, said case not concurred with and overruled. [Paras D, G, I, 188] Judicial Precedent – Overruling of the long-settled law in *PV Narasimha Rao’s case, if warranted: Held : Period of time over which the case has held the field is not of primary consequence – It is not appropriate for this Court to confine itself to a rigid understanding of the doctrine of stare decisis – Ability of this Court to reconsider its decisions is necessary for the organic development of law and the advancement of justice – If this Court is denuded of its power to reconsider its decisions, the development of constitutional jurisprudence would virtually come to a standstill – Thus, reconsidering *PV Narasimha Rao’s case does not violate the principle of stare decisis – *PV Narasimha Rao’s case has wide ramifications on public interest, probity in public life and the functioning of parliamentary democracy – It contains several apparent errors, its interpretation of the text of Art. 105; its conceptualization of the scope and purpose of parliamentary 464 [2024] 3 S.C.R. Digital Supreme Court Reports privilege and its approach to international jurisprudence all of which resulted in a paradoxical outcome – There is an imminent threat of allowing an error to be perpetuated if the decision in *PV Narasimha Rao’s case is not reconsidered – Mistaken interpretation of the Constitution, must not be perpetuted merely because of rigid allegiance to a previous opinion of five judges of this Court. [Paras 31, 33, 40, 44, 188.1] Constitution of India – Arts. 105 and 194 – Parliamentary privileges, if collective right of the house – Two constituent elements of privileges: Held: First is the sum of rights enjoyed by the House of Parliament collectively and the second is the rights enjoyed by members of the House individually – Rights and immunities such as the power to regulate its own procedure, the power to punish for contempt of the House or to expel a member, belong to the first element of privileges held by the House as a collective body for its proper functioning, protection of members, and vindication of its own authority and dignity – Second element of rights exercised individually by members of the House includes freedom of speech and freedom from arrest, among others – Privilege exercised by members individually is in turn qualified by its necessity, in that the privilege must be such that “without which they could not discharge their functions” – These privileges enjoyed by members of the House individually are a means to ensure and facilitate the effective discharge of the collective functions of the House – Privileges enjoyed by members of the House which exceed those possessed by other bodies or individuals, are not absolute or unqualified – Thus, the privileges and immunities enshrined in Arts. 105 and 194 belong to the House collectively – Exercise of the privileges individually by members must be tested on the anvil of whether it is tethered to the healthy and essential functioning of the House.
