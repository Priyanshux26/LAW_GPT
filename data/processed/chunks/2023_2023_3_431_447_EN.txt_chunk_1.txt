Arguendo, that there be some semblance of truth in the allegations, the punishment meted out was disproportionate. [Paras 36, 37][442-H; 443-A-B] E 1.2 The appellant has served the country for over 31 ½ years without blame or blemish, and has received various awards, inter alia, including medal from Hon’ble the President of India. The appellant’s track record is otherwise unquestionable. On the alleged criminality, the undisputed and uncontroverted fact F remains that the appellant was commanding the Force operating over a large area, including from where the Jerrycans allegedly moved from the Indian side to the Pakistani side. However, it is equally not in dispute that the actual manning of the area is by the subordinate personnel of the Force. In the present instance, the subordinate personnel have been adjudged guilty, indicating G their active involvement. Being the persons on the spot, it was their primary responsibility to ensure that no crimes/offences/ questionable incidents took place on their watch. Moreover, there is no direct evidence against the appellant. [Paras 38, 41][443-C, E-G] H B. S. HARI COMMANDANT v. UNION OF INDIA & ORS. 433 1.3 Save and except Subedar DS’s statement, roping in the A appellant, there is no material against him. Hence, ceteris paribus, without other material(s) incriminating the appellant or pointing to his guilt, the statement of a single person alone, ought not to have, in this instance, resulted in his conviction. At the proximate time, the search of the appellant’s house, did not result in recovery B of any incriminating documents/articles. Such non-recovery would obviously enure to the appellant’s benefit. [Paras 45, 46][445-C- D] 1.4 Article 226 of the Constitution is a succour to remedy injustice, and any limit on exercise of such power, is only self- C imposed. The High Courts, under the Constitutional scheme, are endowed with the ability to issue prerogative writs to safeguard rights of citizens. For exactly this reason, this Court has never laid down any strait-jacket principles that can be said to have “cribbed, cabined and confined” the extraordinary powers vested under Articles 226 or 227 of the Constitution. This was a fit case D for the High Court to have examined the matter threadbare, more so, when it did not involve navigating a factual minefield. The Impugned Judgement is quashed and set aside. The conviction and sentence awarded by the GSFC is also set aside. The appellant is held entitled to full retiral benefits from the date of his E superannuation till date.
